Refugees were shot, run over by tanks or trucks, and bayoneted by the Soviet Army after they raised a white flag. After two hours, well over one thousand Japanese refugees, mostly women and children, had been killed. Several Chinese soldiers chased a group of Japanese refugees into a river, where many drowned. Some women were stripped and raped by soldiers. A woman was stripped and killed by a Chinese soldier after her child was killed by Red Army Soldiers. They also beat mothers into submission in order to steal children. In the market a Japanese boy could sell for 300 yen, a girl for 500 yen.\n\nReferences\nCitations\nSources\nTsuchiya Okushi (August 1976). \u6bba\u622e\u306e\u8349\u539f \u6e80\u5dde\u30fb\u845b\u6839\u5edf\u4e8b\u4ef6\u306e\u8a3c\u8a00.
