At Jilin, which is the terminus of the Shenji Railway, it connects to the Changtu Railway and the Changhun Intercity Railway, and at Shulan it connects to the Labin Railway and the Taoshu Railway.\n\nHistory\nThe railway line between Longtanshan and Shulan, named the Longshu Line, was originally created in 1941 by the Manchukuo National Railway, by building a new stretch of railway to connect the Jilin\u2013Jinzhu Jinzhu Line with the Meiyao\u2013Shulan Meiyao Line, both of which had been built by the privately owned Jilin Railway. This line was destroyed in 1945 during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. China Railway rebuilt the line between 1958 and 1966, as the distance between Jilin and Harbin is 68 km (42 mi) shorter via this route than via the Labin Railway.\n\nRoute\n\n\n== References =="}
