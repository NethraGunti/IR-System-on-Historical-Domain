Francisco Franco informed the British government that Mussolini's Italian troops would abandon the Balearic Islands after the war and the British government agreed to arrange the surrender of the Republican garrison.\n\nThe rising\nOn 8 January 1939 Admiral Luis Gonz\u00e1lez de Ubieta was transferred to Menorca to take the command of the Spanish Republican naval base at Puerto Mahon. He also was given the authority to command all the Republican military forces on the island.On 7 February, the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Devonshire came to the Mah\u00f3n harbour with a Nationalist emissary, Fernando Sartorius, on board. Sartorius said to the Republican commander, Luis Gonz\u00e1lez Ubieta, that the Nationalist forces would occupy the island on 8 February, but the Republican officers and supporters would abandon the island. The same day, three battalions of the Republican garrison, led by a member of the Fifth column, the officer Juan Thomas, occupied Ciutadella, after killing the Republican commander Marcelino Rodr\u00edguez. One brigade of Republican troops arrived from Mahon, and defeated the rebel troops after a brief engagement and surrounded Ciutadella. Nevertheless, the Republican officers believed that the fight was useless, desired to abandon the island and the British arranged the surrender of the island to the Nationalists on board of HMS Devonshire. On 8 February, Italian and Spanish Nationalist bombers attacked Mah\u00f3n. The same day the Devonshire sailed to Marseille with 452 Republican refugees on board. On 9 February, the 105th division of the Nationalist Army disembarked at the Ciudadela and the Republican troops surrendered.\n\nAftermath\nAfter the surrender of Menorca, many Republican officers in the central zone believed that they would negotiate a deal with the Nationalists, and then started to plan a coup against the Negr\u00edn government.\n\n\n== References =="}
