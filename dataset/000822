He was a power forward with a 10-year National Basketball Association career from 1961 to 1971. He played for the Philadelphia/San Francisco Warriors and the Seattle SuperSonics. He led the league in personal fouls in 1962 and played in the 1963 NBA All-Star Game. His jersey, number 14, was retired by the Warriors.\n\nEarly years\nMeschery was born as Tomislav Nikolayevich Meshcheryakov in Harbin, Manchukuo. His parents were Russian emigrants who fled from the October Revolution in 1917.  The Meschery family was later relocated to a Japanese internment camp near Tokyo during World War II.After the war, Meschery and his parents emigrated to the United States. It was also in this phase of his life where his father renamed the family \"Meschery\" due to the anti-Communist/anti-Soviet Red Scare under Joseph McCarthy, and Tomislav Nikolayevich was renamed Thomas Nicholas, which later was abbreviated to Tom. Living in San Francisco, California, Meschery attended Lowell High School.\nAfter graduating in 1957, he went to Saint Mary's College of California in Moraga.  Meschery helped Saint Mary's reach the NCAA Tournament's Elite Eight in 1959. Two years later, he was chosen as a First Team All-American, and was named the West Coast Conference Player of the Year.  He received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1961.\n\nProfessional basketball career\nStanding 6 ft 6 in, Meschery also was a highly talented basketball player. After graduating from St. Mary's, he was drafted by the Philadelphia Warriors as the 7th pick overall in the 1961 NBA draft. Meschery played alongside legend Wilt Chamberlain, to whom he later dedicated a poem.  Meschery was the starting forward on the 1961-62 Philadelphia Warriors team in which Chamberlain scored 100 points. Meschery led the NBA in personal fouls in 1962 and he became the first foreign born player to play in an NBA All-Star Game when he played in the 1963 NBA All-Star Game.  Chamberlain left the Warriors in 1965, returning to his home town Philadelphia, to play with the 76ers. The Warriors however, strengthened by the arrival of Rick Barry, made it to the 1967 NBA Finals, in which they lost to Chamberlain's 76ers. After his NBA Finals appearance, Meschery was selected by the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics during the 1967 NBA Expansion Draft.\nIn the SuperSonics' inaugural season, Meschery led the team in rebounds (10.2 per game) as well as personal fouls.   He retired following the 1970\u201371 season, having played four seasons for the SuperSonics.\nAfter retiring as a player, Meschery became head coach of the ABA's Carolina Cougars, which he guided to a record of 35\u201349 in the 1971\u201372 season before being replaced by Larry Brown.Meschery has been inducted into the San Francisco High School Hall of Fame; Saint Mary's College Hall of Fame (his college jersey #31 retired); and the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nPost-basketball life\nMeschery published his first book of poems in 1970, and returned to school after his coaching stint, receiving his Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Iowa in 1974. He studied poetry with Mark Strand, U.S. poet laureate, at the University of Washington. After receiving his teaching credentials at the University of Nevada, Reno, Meschery taught high school English at Reno High School in Reno, Nevada, until his retirement from teaching in 2005. He is also a poet, whose works often relate to basketball, teaching, and being a Russian immigrant. In 2002, Meschery was inducted into the Nevada Writers Hall of Fame.\nMeschery is now living in Sacramento, California with his wife, artist Melanie Marchant Meschery. His son is Matthew Meschery who is the former lead vocalist of OPM. Meschery continues to write poems, fiction, and essays. He traces his love of writing to his Russian maternal ancestors, Alexei and Leo Tolstoy. Embarking on a new career as a novelist, Meschery has completed three novels in manuscript: Mr. Dolby's Dream, She's Got Game, and The Kid Has Hops and a young adult novel, also in manuscript, entitled The Society for the Prevention of Bullying. He has two published collections of poetry: Nothing We Lose Can Be Replaced and Some Men and Sweat: New and Selected Poems About Sports. Meschery and his wife Melanie are presently collaborating on a book of poems and art about saints.\nHis blog 'Meschery's Musings' discusses a variety of controversial subjects relating to sports. Each blog ends with a sports poem. Meschery says he wishes to introduce the public to fine contemporary poems whose subject is sports in the same way Garrison Keillor makes poetry in general available to his listeners on his morning radio broadcasts.\n\nNBA career statistics\nRegular season\nPlayoffs\nWorks\nOver the Rim (1970), New York: McCall Publishing.\nCaught in the Pivot: a Diary of a Rookie Coach in the Exploding World of Pro Basketball (1973).
