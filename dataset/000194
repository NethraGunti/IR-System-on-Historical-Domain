Initially, during the invasion of Poland by Germany and the Soviet Union, the territory temporarily fell under the Soviet occupation in 1939 as part of Soviet Ukraine.\nThen Adolf Hitler (Document No. 1997-PS of 17 July 1941) formed a capital in Lemberg (Lviv), the Galizien province existed from 1941 until 1944. It ceased to exist after the Soviet counter-offensive.\n\nHistory\nDistrict of Galicia comprised mainly the pre-war Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship of the Second Polish Republic, today part of western Ukraine. The territory was taken over by Nazi Germany in 1941 after the attack on USSR and incorporated into the General Government, governed by Gauleiter Hans Frank since the invasion of 1939. The region was taken over again by the Soviet Union in 1944.\nThe district area was managed by Frank's brother-in-law Karl Lasch (de, pl) from 1 August 1941 to 6 January 1942, and by SS Brigadef\u00fchrer Dr. Otto W\u00e4chter from 6 January 1942 to September 1943. W\u00e4chter utilised the district capital Lemberg as a recruitment base for the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS Galicia (1st Ukrainian). In the course of the Holocaust in occupied Poland starting from the year of the invasion, the largest Jewish extermination ghettos were created in Lw\u00f3w (Lemberg) and in Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w (Stanislau).\n\nGovernors of the District Galizien (German occupation)\nSee also\nAdministrative division of Polish territories during World War II\nSoviet annexation of Western Ukraine, 1939\u20131940\n\n\n== References =="}
