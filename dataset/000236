The battle took place in the vicinity of Husynne manor, some 7 kilometres (4.3 mi) to the north east of the town of Hrubiesz\u00f3w. In the effect of a swift cavalry charge, a Polish improvised cavalry unit broke through Soviet infantry lines, but were then decimated by Soviet tanks.\nOn 23 September the 8th Rifle Corps of the Red Army crossed the Bug River near Hrubiesz\u00f3w. The unit, consisting of 44th and 81st Rifle Divisions, captured the town and headed westwards. It was met by an improvised Polish cavalry unit operating in the area. The Polish force, commanded by Major Witold Radziulewicz (retired), was composed of a march squadron of the 14th Regiment of Jazlowiec Uhlans, reinforced by a squadron of mobilised mounted police from Warsaw and a weakened battalion of chemical defence troops, some 1500 men strong and armed with 36 81 mm wz. 31 mortars commanded by Capt. J\u00f3zef Cwynar.The Polish commander was heading southwards, towards the border with Hungary and Romania. Radziulewicz decided to break through the ranks of Soviet infantry and continue his march. The Soviet infantry started an assault of the Polish formation in an open field, but were met by a counter-charge of 400 Polish policemen, supported by the sudden bombardment of the mortar battery. The sudden counterattack caused panic in the Soviet lines and the Soviet infantry started a hasty retreat. However, soon afterwards a Soviet tank detachment appeared from the Bug River valley. After a brief fight, the Poles were overwhelmed, surrounded and forced to surrender after the mortars had used up all the ammunition supplies.In the effect of the bloody engagement the Soviets lost several hundred killed and wounded. The Polish side lost 18 killed and 139 wounded. After the battle at least 25 Polish prisoners of war were murdered by the Soviets, they are buried in a small war cemetery in Rogalin and in Husynne.\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\n(in Polish) Wiktor Krzysztof Cygan (1990).
