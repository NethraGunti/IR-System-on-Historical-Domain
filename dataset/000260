A small Polish garrison of three World War I forts (consisting of two infantry battalions) successfully defended the bridgehead against the entire German panzer division for the entire day and night. However, as a result of a misunderstanding of the commander in chief's orders, the Polish forces were then withdrawn to the other side of the river, and then further eastwards on the 6 September.\n\nReferences\nExternal Links\n(in Polish) Robert Olbry\u015b (2003) R\u00f3\u017can w wojnie obronnej 1939 r..
