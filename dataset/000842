In 1984, she was the subject of the documentary Jazz Is My Native Language. In 1996, she published her autobiography, Life with Jazz, and in 2007 she was named an NEA Jazz Master by the U.S. National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nBiography\nAkiyoshi was born in Liaoyang, Manchuria to Japanese emigrants. She was the youngest of four sisters. In 1945, after World War II, Akiyoshi's family lost their home and returned to Japan, settling in Beppu. A local record collector introduced her to jazz by playing a record of Teddy Wilson playing \"Sweet Lorraine\". She immediately loved the sound and began to study jazz. In 1952, during a tour of Japan, pianist Oscar Peterson discovered her playing in a club on the Ginza. Peterson was impressed and convinced record producer Norman Granz to record her. In 1953, under Granz's direction, she recorded her first album with Peterson's rhythm section: Herb Ellis on guitar, Ray Brown on double bass, and J. C. Heard on drums. The album was released with the title Toshiko's Piano in the U.S. and Amazing Toshiko Akiyoshi in Japan.Akiyoshi studied jazz in at the Berklee School of Music in Boston. In 1955, she wrote a letter to Lawrence Berk asking him to give her a chance to study at his school. After a year of wrangling with the State Department and Japanese officials, Berk was given permission for Akiyoshi to enroll. He offered her a full scholarship, and he mailed her a plane ticket to Boston. In January 1956, she became the first Japanese student at Berklee. Soon after, she appeared as a contestant on the 18 March 1956 broadcast of the CBS television panel show What's My Line?. In 1998, she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music.Akiyoshi married saxophonist Charlie Mariano in 1959. The couple had a daughter, Michiru. She and Mariano divorced in 1967 after forming several bands together. During the same year, she met saxophonist Lew Tabackin, whom she married in 1969. Akiyoshi, Tabackin, and Michiru moved to Los Angeles in 1972. In March 1973, Akiyoshi and Tabackin formed a 16-piece big band composed of studio musicians. Akiyoshi composed and arranged music for the band, and Tabackin served as the band's featured soloist on tenor saxophone and flute. The band recorded its first album, Kogun, in 1974. The title, which translates to \"one-man army\", was inspired by the tale of a Japanese soldier lost for 30 years in the jungle who believed that World War II was still being fought and thus remained loyal to the Emperor. Kogun was commercially successful in Japan, and the band began to receive critical acclaim.The couple moved to New York City in 1982 and assembled the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra featuring Lew Tabackin). Akiyoshi toured with smaller bands to raise money for her big band. BMG continued to release her big band's recordings in Japan but remained skeptical about releasing the music in the United States Although Akiyoshi was able to release several albums in the U.S. featuring her piano in solo and small combo settings, many of her later big band albums were released only in Japan.\nOn Monday, 29 December 2003, her band played its final concert at Birdland in New York City, where it had enjoyed a regular Monday night gig for more than seven years. Akiyoshi explained that she disbanded the ensemble because she was frustrated by her inability to obtain U.S. recording contracts for the big band. She also said that she wanted to concentrate on her piano playing from which she had been distracted by years of composing and arranging. She has said that although she has rarely recorded as a solo pianist, that is her preferred format. On 24 March 2004, Warner Japan released the final recording of Akiyoshi's big band. Titled Last Live in Blue Note Tokyo, the album was recorded on 28\u201329 November 2003.\n\nMusic\nAkiyoshi's music is distinctive for its textures and for its Japanese influence. When Duke Ellington died in 1974, Nat Hentoff wrote in The Village Voice that Ellington's music reflected his African heritage. Akiyoshi was inspired to investigate her Japanese musical heritage. She composed using Japanese themes, harmonies, and instruments (kotsuzumi, kakko, utai, tsugaru shamisen). But her music remained planted firmly in jazz, reflecting influences from Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, and Bud Powell.\nOne reviewer of the live album Road Time said the music on her big band albums demonstrated \"a level of compositional and orchestral ingenuity that made her one of perhaps two or three composer-arrangers in jazz whose name could seriously be mentioned in the company of Duke Ellington, Eddie Sauter and Gil Evans.\"In 1999, Akiyoshi was approached by  Kyudo Nakagawa, a Buddhist priest, who asked her to write a piece for his hometown of Hiroshima. He sent her some photos of the aftermath of the nuclear bombing. Her initial reaction was horror. She could not see how she could compose anything to address the event. Finally she found a picture of a young woman emerging from an underground shelter with a faint smile on her face. Akiyoshi said that after seeing this picture, she understood the message: hope. With that message in mind, she composed the three-part suite Hiroshima: Rising from the Abyss. The piece was premiered in Hiroshima on 6 August 2001, the 56th anniversary of the Hiroshima bombing. The Hiroshima suite appeared on the 2002 album Hiroshima \u2013 Rising from the Abyss.\n\nAwards and honors\nNEA Jazz Master, 2007\nJazz Album of the Year: Long Yellow Road, Stereo Review, 1976\nGold Disk: Insights, Swing Journal\nSilver Disk: Kogun, Salted Gingko Nuts,  Four Seasons of Morita Village,  Swing Journal\nSpecial Award: (50th Anniversary Concert in Japan), Swing Journal\nDown Beat magazine Readers' Poll winner:Arranger: 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1989, 1995\nBig Band: 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982\nComposer: 1980, 1981, 1982, 1986\nDown Beat magazine Critics' Poll winner:Jazz Album of the Year: 1978 (Insights)\nArranger: 1979, 1982, 1990, 1995, 1996\nBig Band: 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983\nComposer: 1981, 1982\nGrammy Award nominations:Best Jazz Instrumental Performance \u2013 Big Band: 1976 (Long Yellow Road), 1977 (Road Time), 1978 (Insights), 1979 (Kogun), 1980 (Farewell), 1981 (Tanuki's Night Out), 1984 (Ten Gallon Shuffle), 1985 (March of the Tadpoles),  1992 (Carnegie Hall Concert), 1994 (Desert Lady / Fantasy).\nBest Arrangement on an Instrumental: 1981 (for \"A Bit Byas'd\"), 1983 (for \"Remembering Bud\"), 1985 (for \"March of the Tadpoles\"), 1994 (for \"Bebop\")\n\nDiscography\n1954 Toshiko's Piano (Norgran)\n1955 The Toshiko Trio (Storyville)\n1956 Toshiko \u2013 Her Trio, Her Quartet (Storyville)\n1957 Toshiko and Leon Sash at Newport (Verve)\n1957 The Many Sides of Toshiko (Verve)\n1958 United Notions (MetroJazz)\n1961 The Toshiko\u2013Mariano Quartet (Candid)\n1961 Long Yellow Road (Asahi Sonorama)\n1961 Toshiko Meets Her Old Pals (King)\n1963 Toshiko\u2013Mariano Quartet (in West Side) (Takt/Nippon Columbia)\n1963 East and West (RCA Victor)\n1963 The Country and Western Sound of Jazz Pianos with Steve Kuhn (Dauntless)\n1963 Miwaku No Jazz (Victor)\n1964 Toshiko Mariano and her Big Band (Vee-Jay Records)\n1965 Lullabies for You (Nippon Columbia)\n1969 Toshiko at Top of the Gate (Nippon Columbia)\n1970 Toshiko Akiyoshi in Japan (Liberty)\n1971 Jazz, the Personal Dimension (Victor)\n1971 Meditation (Dan Records)\n1971 Sumie (Victor)\n1971 Solo Piano (RCA Victor)\n1974 Kogun (RCA)\n1975 Long Yellow Road (RCA)\n1976 Tales of a Courtesan (Oirantan) (RCA)\n1976 Road Time (RCA)\n1976 Insights (RCA)\n1976 Dedications (Discomate)\n1977 Dedications II (Discomate)\n1977 March of the Tadpoles (RCA)\n1977 Live at Newport '77 (RCA)\n1977 Live at Newport II (RCA)\n1978 Salted Gingko Nuts (Ascent)\n1978 Toshiko Plays Billy Strayhorn (Discomate)\n1978 Finesse (Concord Jazz)\n1979 Notorious Tourist from the East (Inner City)\n1979 Sumi-e (Insights)\n1980 Farewell (RCA)\n1981 From Toshiko with Love (Baystate)\n1982 European Memoirs (Baystate)\n1983 Toshiko Akiyoshi Trio (Eastworld)\n1984 Ten Gallon Shuffle (Baystate)\n1984 Time Stream (Toshiko Akiyoshi Trio album) (Eastworld)\n1986 Wishing Peace (Ascent)\n1987 Interlude (Concord Jazz)\n1990 Four Seasons (Nippon Crown/Ninety-One)\n1991 Chic Lady (Ninety-One)\n1991 Live at Birdland (Fresh Sound)\n1992 Carnegie Hall Concert (Columbia Records)\n1992 Remembering Bud: Cleopatra's Dream (Evidence)\n1994 Desert Lady / Fantasy (Columbia)\n1993 Dig (Ninety-One)\n1994 Night and Dream (Ninety-One)\n1995 Yes, I Have No 4 Beat Today (Ninety-One)\n1994 Toshiko Akiyoshi at Maybeck (Concord Jazz)\n1996 Four Seasons of Morita Village (Novus)\n1996 Time Stream: Toshiko Plays Toshiko (Ninety-One)\n1997 Toshiko Akiyoshi Trio Live at Blue Note Tokyo '97 (Ninety-One)\n1998 Monopoly Game (Novus)\n1999 Sketches of Japan (Ninety-One)\n1999 Tribute to Duke Ellington (Novus)\n2000 Toshiko Akiyoshi Solo Live at the Kennedy Center (Crown)\n2001 Hiroshima \u2013 Rising from the Abyss (Video Arts)\n2004 Last Live in Blue Note Tokyo (Warner Music)\n2004 New York Sketch Book (Ninety-One)\n2006 Hope (Ninety-One)\n2006 50th Anniversary Concert in Japan (T-toc Records)\n2008 Let Freedom Swing with the SWR Big Band (H\u00e4nssler)\n2008 Vintage (Toshiko Akiyoshi and Lew Tabackin album) (T-toc Records)\n2009 Solo Live 2004 (Live at \"Studio F\") (Studio Songs)\n2010 Classic Encounters (Studio Songs)\n2011 Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra in Shanghai (Pony Canyon)\n2015 Jazz Conversations (Victor Entertainment)\n2016 Toshiko Akiyoshi Plays Gershwin's Porgy And Bess (Studio Songs)\n2017 My Long Yellow Road (Studio Songs)\n2019 The Eternal Duo!
