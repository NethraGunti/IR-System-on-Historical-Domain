He graduated from a local school and became a worker in a sugar factory. Following the Russian Civil War, in 1924 he joined the Red Army and graduated from a school of artillery. In 1934 he received further training at the Borisoglebsk Military Aviation School. As a pilot of fighter-bombers he took part in the Khalkhyn-Gol battles against Japan and in the German and Soviet Invasion of Poland in 1939. Until 1940 he also served on the Finnish front during the Winter War.\n\nCareer\nIn 1941 he received officer's training in the Military Aviation Academy and became the commanding officer of the Soviet 65th Air Regiment of the Leningrad Military District. On that post he remained until the beginning of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. On July 6, 1941, although wounded in action, Vitruk remained on duty and was promoted to the rank of Lt. Colonel. He commanded his regiment during the transfer of equipment from the outdated Polikarpov I-15bis to the new Ilyushin Il-2. Following the transfer and training of the crews the regiment was divided and Vitruk continued to command one of its parts. In October 1941 it was transferred to the Western Front near Moscow. By early 1942 he accomplished his 21st sortie, without any successes. However, for his superb command of the regiment on February 24, 1942, he was awarded with the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union.\nIn July 1942 Vitruk became the commanding officer of the 291st Division, later transformed into the 10th Guards Division of the VVS. On that post he commanded his unit during the battles of Voronezh, Kiev, T\u00e2rgul Frumos and the Iassy-Chisinau operation. Later on he took part in the battles leading to the Soviet capture of Ploie\u0219ti, Bucharest and Craiova in Romania, as well as Belgrade in Yugoslavia and Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in Hungary. For his actions during the Yugoslavian campaign he was awarded with the title of the Hero of Yugoslavia.\n\nDeath\nHe died of a serious disease on June 1, 1946, and was buried in Kiev.\n\nAwards\nHero of the Soviet Union\nOrder of Lenin\nOrder of the Red Banner, four times\nOrder of Suvorov, 2nd class\nOrder of Kutuzov, 2nd class\nOrder of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 2nd class\nOrder of Alexander Nevsky\nOrder of the Red Star\nOrder of the National Hero of Yugoslavia\n\nNotes\nExternal links\nBiography on War Heroes site (in Russian)"}
