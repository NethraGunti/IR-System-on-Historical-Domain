Its head office was in Mukden, the largest city of Manchukuo.\n\nHistory\nFounded on March 26, 1934, D\u014dwa Automotive was a joint venture of the South Manchurian Railway Company, the government of Manchukuo, and 7 Japanese companies. Following World War I, the Imperial Japanese Army saw the need for increased mechanization, and the Kwantung Army began to import foreign-built vehicles, including the Model 25 Vickers Crossley Armored Car. After the formation of the Empire of Manchukuo, the Kwantung Army's economic policy of self-sufficiency in major strategic heavy industry spurred the need for locally-built trucks and automobiles. D\u014dwa began with the assistance of T\u014dky\u014d Jid\u014dsha Kogyo (the forerunner of Isuzu) to build vehicles from knock-down kits, as the infrastructure of sub-suppliers was gradually increased to permit more and more local content. Initial production was estimated at 5000 vehicles per year, many of which were copies of the Crossley design.D\u014dwa Automotive was absorbed into the new Manchurian Automotive Production Company (\u6e80\u5dde\u81ea\u52d5\u8eca\u88fd\u9020\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e, Mansh\u016b Jid\u014dsha Seiz\u014d Kabushiki Kaisha), a state combine and subsidiary of the Manchurian Heavy Industries in 1940.\n\n\n== References =="}
