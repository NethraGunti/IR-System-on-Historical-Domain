Rybitwa participated in the defence of Poland during the Nazi German invasion of 1939. The ship was damaged by a German bomb on 14 September 1939. The ship was later captured by the Germans, but returned to serve under the Polish flag after the War.\n\nHistory\nConstruction\nRybitwa was constructed in the riverine dockyard in Modlin between 1933 and 1935. The first commander of the ship was Lieutenant Commander Jerzy Kossakowski. The ship was named after the bird tern, \"Rybitwa\" in Polish.\n\nService\nLieutenant Commander Kazimierz Mi\u0142adowski was the captain of the ship during the September campaign. On 26 or 27 August  Rybitwa, which together with two other Polish ships had been stationed in Riga, Latvia, left for Gdynia, along with ORP Czajka on full combat alert. After arriving in Gdynia she conducted reconnaissance operations in Gda\u0144sk Bay, between the Free City of Danzig and the East Prussian coast. On 1 September 1939, after the outbreak of the Second World War, Rybitwa and all other 5 minesweepers of her class joined with the minelayer Gryf and took part in the Operation Rurka, an attempt to mine the entrances of the Gda\u0144sk Bay.\n\nThe Polish flotilla, which included the destroyer Wicher and two gunboats, was attacked by a large formation of German bombers. Rybitwa's sister ship, Mewa, was hit. Despite the great risk involved, the captain of Rybitwa, Mi\u0142adowski, made the decision to tow Mewa into port; the operation was a success.\nIn the next few weeks, the ship was based at the port of Jastarnia and conducted patrols and mine laying operations at night, while defending the Hel peninsula during the day. On 19 September, Rybitwa was damaged by bombs while still in port - most of the crew were not onboard at the time. In order to prevent capture by German troops, the ship was scuttled soon after. The Polish defense of Hel peninsula lasted until 2 October. The Germans refloated the ship, renamed her Rixh\u00f6ft and commissioned her into the Kriegsmarine. After the end of World War II the Polish naval mission in Germany found Rybitwa together with three of her sister ships in Travem\u00fcnde. The Polish flag was raised again and her original name was restored. Though under British supervision, the German crew purposely destroyed much of their equipment but Polish sailors managed to make the ships seaworthy again and the ships returned to Poland.Rybitwa served in various roles up to 1972 when she was finally decommissioned and scrapped.\n\nIn popular culture\nRybitwa, along with other Polish ships of the Jask\u00f3\u0142ka class, is mentioned in the G\u00fcnter Grass novella Cat and Mouse.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\npics of Rybitwa on www.1939.pl"}
