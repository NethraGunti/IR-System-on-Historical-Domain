It was named Mansh\u016b or Mansy\u00fb in short.\n\nHistory\nThe Manchuria Airplane Manufacturing Company was established in late 1938 under the supervision of the Japanese government as a subsidiary of the Nakajima Aircraft Company of Japan. Its main plant was located in Harbin, Manchukuo.\nFrom 1941 to 1945, Mansh\u016b produced a total of 2,196 airframes (eighth among Japanese airframe manufacturers), of which 798 were combat aircraft. The company also produced 2,168 aircraft engines (sixth among Japanese aircraft engine manufacturers). In addition, Mansh\u016b provided repair services for a variety of aircraft in the Manchukuo Air Force and for Imperial Japanese Army Air Force units stationed in Manchukuo.\nThe Red Army confiscated the company's factory and equipment in 1945 at the end of World War II, and the Soviets took much of its equipment back to the Soviet Union as war reparations. Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation, one of the major aircraft producers in the People's Republic of China, redeveloped the site.\n\nLicensed production\nMansh\u016b produced a variety of Japanese aircraft under license production agreements:\n\nKawasaki Ki-10 (World War II Allied reporting name \"Perry\") fighter\nKawasaki Ki-32 (Allied reporting name \"Mary\") light bomber\nKawasaki Ki-45 Toryu (Allied reporting name \"Nick\") twin-engined fighter\nKawasaki Ki-61 Hien (Allied reporting name \"Tony\") fighter\nKawasaki Type 88 (KDA-2) light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft\nMitsubishi Ki-15 (Allied reporting name \"Babs\") reconnaissance aircraft\nMitsubishi Ki-30 (Allied reporting name \"Ann\") light bomber\nMitsubishi Ki-46 (Allied reporting name \"Dinah\") reconnaissance aircraft\nMansh\u016b Super Universal (license built Fokker Super Universal)\nNakajima Ki-27 (Allied reporting name \"Nate\") light fighter (1,379 units)\nNakajima Ki-34 (Allied reporting name \"Thora\") transport\nNakajima Ki-43Ia Hayabusa (Allied reporting name \"Oscar\") fighter\nNakajima Ki-44Ia Shoki (Allied reporting name \"Tojo\") fighter\nNakajima Ki-84 Hayate (Allied reporting name \"Frank\") advanced fighter (94 units)\nNakajima Ki-116 advanced fighter, also known as Mansh\u016b Ki-116\nNakajima Type 91 (NC) fighter\nTachikawa Ki-9 (Allied reporting name \"Spruce\") intermediate trainer\nTachikawa Ki-54 (Allied reporting name \"Hickory\") advanced trainer\nTachikawa Ki-55 (Allied reporting name \"Ida\") advanced trainer\n\nIndependent designs\nMansh\u016b also developed a number of aircraft independently:\n\nMansh\u016b Hayabusa I, II, and III airliner (30 units)\nMansh\u016b Ki-79 advanced trainer\nMansh\u016b Ki-71 dive bomber prototype (Allied reporting name \"Edna\")\nMansh\u016b Ki-98 advanced twin-boom high-altitude interceptor projectAmong the Mansh\u016b independent designs, however, only the Ki-79 advanced trainer reached mass production, as the Army Type 2 Advanced Trainer.\n\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliographyFrancillon, Rene (1979).
