He made his debut as a manga artist in 1955 with kashi-hon manga. He started as an assistant of Osamu Tezuka in 1958, but is primarily known for starting out as an assistant of Fujio Akatsuka five years later. He is best known for his series Dame Oyaji (\"No-Good Dad\", 1970\u20131982), which gained notoriety by giving a darkly humorous send-up of Japanese family life with a meek, pathetic father married to a cruel and savage wife. The series received the 1979 Shogakukan Manga Award for sh\u014dnen, was adapted into a movie in 1973 and as an anime television series in 1974.\n\nSelected works\nTangerine Flowers Blooming on a Hill (\u307f\u304b\u3093\u306e\u82b1\u3055\u304f\u4e18, 1955, Shimura Publishing)\nNetaro-kun (Manga Shonen)\nHachamecha Lab (Manga Shonen)\nPinky-chan (\u30d4\u30f3\u30ad\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093 , 1968-1969, Shojo Friend)\nMako-chan (Shojo Friend)\nPrincess Pudding-chan (\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u30bb\u30b9\u30d7\u30ea\u30f3\u3061\u3083\u3093, January to December 1969, Nakayoshi)- Also published in extra New Year and Spring special issues\nNo-Good Father (\u30c0\u30e1\u304a\u3084\u3058, 1970-1982, Weekly Shonen Sunday #43 to #30)\nMandamu Oyako (\u30de\u30f3\u30c0\u30e0\u89aa\u5b50, 1971-1972, Weekly Shonen King)\nDotekabo-chan (\u30c9\u30c6\u304b\u307c\u3061\u3083\u3093, Weekly Shonen King)\nGutara Mama (\u3050\u3046\u305f\u3089\u30de\u30de, April to July 1971, Separate Edition Shonen Magazine)- Prototype to better-known version of the series\nDokudami-sensei (\u3069\u304f\u3060\u307f\u5148\u751f, 1973-1974, Weekly Shonen Champion)\nTecchan (\u624b\u3063\u3061\u3083\u3093, Weekly Shonen Champion)\nChitaro of the Graveyard (\u5893\u5834\u306e\u8840\u592a\u90ce, Weekly Shonen Champion)\nTomurai-kun (\u3068\u3080\u3089\u3044\u30af\u30f3)\nGutara Mama (\u3050\u3046\u305f\u3089\u30de\u30de, 1975-, Mainichi Shimbun \"Sunday Club\")\nMother-Loving Chidori (\u6bcd\u604b\u3044\u5343\u9ce5, 1975, Princess)\nRakugo Artist Biography (\u5bc4\u5e2d\u82b8\u4eba\u4f1d, August 25, 1978-November 25, 1989, Big Comic)\nHachamecharabo (\u30cf\u30c1\u30e3\u30e1\u30c1\u30e3\u30e9\u30dc, 1979)\nUwasa no Night Man (\u5642\u306e\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8\u30de\u30f3, 1980)\nTake it Easy Dabo-san (\u3086\u3063\u304f\u308a\u30c0\u30dc\u3055\u3093, 1982)\nDeduction Papa (\u6e1b\u70b9\u30d1\u30d1, January 13, 1983-March 28, 1986, Weekly Post)\nBAR Lemon Heart (\uff22\uff21\uff32\u30ec\u30e2\u30f3\u30fb\u30cf\u30fc\u30c8,1985-, Manga Action)\nOur Jingor\u014d (\u3046\u3061\u306e\u751a\u4e94\u90ce, 1986)\nDowntown Mogu (\u30c0\u30a6\u30f3\u30bf\u30a6\u30f3\u30fb\u30e2\u30b0, Weekly Josei)- co-authored with Yoshiyuki Ichihara\nWhat is the golf?
