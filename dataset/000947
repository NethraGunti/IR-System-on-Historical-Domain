He was an ethnic Mongol belonging to the Plain and Bordered White Banner of Xilin Gol League.\n\nNames\nHistorical sources refer to him under a variety of names:\n\nJodubjab or Jodubdjabu, Roman spellings of his Mongolian name based on the Classical Mongolian alphabet\nJodovjav, a transcription of Mongolian Cyrillic \u0416\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0436\u0430\u0432\nShih Hai (Chinese: \u4ec0\u6d77; pinyin: Sh\u00edh\u01cei or Chinese: \u4e16\u6d77; pinyin: Sh\u00ech\u01cei), his Chinese courtesy name\nTso Shih-hai (Chinese: \u5353\u4ec0\u6d77; pinyin: Zhu\u014d Sh\u00edh\u01cei), a Chinese name which takes the first character of the Chinese transcription of his Mongolian name (Chinese: \u5353\u7279\u5df4\u624e\u666e; pinyin: Zhu\u014dt\u00e8bazh\u0101p\u01d4, less commonly Chinese: \u5353\u7279\u5df4\u624e\u5e03; pinyin: Zhu\u014dt\u00e8bazh\u0101b\u00f9), followed by his Chinese courtesy name\n\nCareer\nDuring the Xinhai Revolution which overthrew the Qing, Khalkha Mongol banners declared independence as the state of Mongolia and occupied Dariganga, which was then under Jodubjab's jurisdiction. This occurred in March 1912. He led an attack in an attempt to recover the area, but on 28 August was taken prisoner and held in Urga (today Ulan Bator). He would be released in 1915 under the terms of the Treaty of Kyakhta (1915). After his return to Inner Mongolia, he was commended by Yuan Shikai's government and commissioned a lieutenant-general. From there he rose to become the senior amban in Chahar Province. During the Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921, he was dispatched in another attempt to re-establish control in Dariganga, but was driven out by Soviet Kalmyk troops and local partisans; the territory would thenceforth remain part of the state of Mongolia.In March 1934, Jodubjab was appointed a member of the Nanjing government's newly established Mongolian Local Autonomous Political Committee, along with Kesingge, Serengdongrub, \u00dcnenbayan, and Nima-odsor of the Kuomintang, and various league and banner nobility such as Altanochir, Darijaya, and Gorjorjab (\u90ed\u5c14\u5353\u5c14\u624e\u5e03). However, in early 1936, Nima-odsor, who was Jodubjab's close friend and advisor, was assassinated by the Japanese for his Mongol nationalism and opposition to Japanese expansionism. In response, Jodubajab, intimidated, began to collaborate with Japan's territorial designs on Inner Mongolia, sparking the ire of Mongol nationalists. In his position as commander of the Mongol militia, he endorsed Prince Demchigdongrob's telegram announcing the establishment of the Mengjiang government. In February of that year, he and Li Shouxin seized control of the postal administration in six districts of eastern Chahar Province. In November of that year, he participated in the Suiyuan Campaign. In 1937 he was appointed one of two deputy commanders of the Mongol Pao An Tui (\u8499\u53e4\u4fdd\u5b89\u968a) along with Pao Yueh-ching (\u5305\u60a6\u537f).Jodubajab was captured during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria during the final days of World War II and again taken to Ulan Bator as a prisoner, where he died.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nAtwood, Christopher (2004), \"Dariganga\", Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, New York: Facts on File, ISBN 978-1-4381-2922-8\n\u5b9d\u529b\u683c \u2014 Bolig (July 2004), \"\u5185\u8499\u53e4\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u5fb7\u7a46\u695a\u514b\u680b\u9c81\u666e \u2014 Demchugdongrub in Inner Mongolian History\", \u9ed1\u9f99\u6c5f\u7701\u8499\u53e4\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4f1a\u901a\u8baf \u2014 Communications of the Heilongjiang Association for Mongolian Studies (20), archived from the original on 2011-08-14, retrieved 2011-08-04CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list (link)\nHyer, Paul; Jagchid, Sechin (1983), A Mongolian living Buddha: biography of the Kanjurwa Khutughtu, SUNY Press, ISBN 978-0-87395-713-7\n\u6700\u65b0\u652f\u90a3\u8981\u4eba\u4f1d \u2014 Newest Biographies of Important Figures in China, \u671d\u65e5\u65b0\u805e\u793e [Asahi Shimbun Company], 1941, OCLC 23310651CS1 maint: extra punctuation (link)"}
