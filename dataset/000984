She served as a news presenter on Nippon Television's late night news programme Kyo-no-dekigoto from 1980 to 1996. She worked on the HIV-tainted blood scandal in Japan during the 1990s.Affiliated with the openly revisionist lobby Nippon Kaigi, Sakurai denies the Nanking Massacre and sexual slavery by the Japanese imperial military during World War II (i.e. \"comfort women\"). (This claim of  denial seems to be contradicted by Yoshiko Sakurai herself during her appearance in the John Pilger documentary 'Japan Behind The Mask' 1987. In the documentary film she acknowledges, and criticizes, Japanese denial of war crimes and suggests students in Japan should be told the hard truth of Japan's imperial past.  She promoted Taniyama Y\u016bjir\u014d's 2015 Scottsboro Girls film in Japan and the United States, a revisionist film aimed at denying the sexual enslavement of comfort women.She is the originator of the term \"Tokutei Asia\".\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nOfficial website\nOn a radio talk show with Shinz\u014d Abe, April 2004"}
