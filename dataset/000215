Following World War I, Poland's shoreline was relatively short and included no major seaports. In the 1920s and 1930s, such ports were built in Gdynia and Hel, and the Polish Navy underwent a modernisation program under the leadership of Counter-Admiral J\u00f3zef Unrug (Commanding Officer of the Fleet) and Vice-Admiral Jerzy \u015awirski (Chief of Naval Staff). Ships were acquired from France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, and the navy was to be able to secure the Polish supply lines in case of a war against the Soviet Union. By September 1939 the Polish Navy consisted of 5 submarines, 4 destroyers, and various support vessels and mine-warfare ships.\nThis force was no match for the large German Navy, and so a strategy of harassment and indirect engagement was implemented. Lacking numerical superiority, Polish naval commanders decided to execute the Peking Plan, an operation to withdraw most of the naval vessels to British ports, from where the ships were to secure convoys with aid for Poland, either bound for Gdynia or for Constanca in Romania.\n\nPeace-time organization\nThe Polish Navy was organized into a Warsaw-based Naval Command, subordinate to the Commander in Chief of the Polish forces, and several naval and riverine bases and flotillas. The navy was commanded by Counter Admiral J\u00f3zef Unrug and his Chief of Naval Staff Jerzy \u015awirski. Apart from its own bases, the navy also commanded the Westerplatte Transit Wharf, an extraterritorial base and depot in the Free City of Danzig, commanded by Henryk Sucharski and Franciszek D\u0105browski. The naval bases included:\n\nGdynia-Oksywie kmdr por. Mieczys\u0142aw Adamowicz\nHel kmdr W\u0142odzimierz Steyer\nPuck Naval air base (2 squadrons and 1 support air group under kmdr por. pil. Edward Szystowski)\nGdynia Naval Officers' SchoolThe navy itself was divided onto four flotillas:\n\nDestroyer flotilla under Lieutenant Commander Roman Stankiewicz\nSubmarine flotilla under Counter Admiral  Adam Mohuczy\nPi\u0144sk river flotilla under Commander Witold Zaj\u0105czkowski\nVistula river detachment under Lieutenant Commander Roman KanafoyskiFinally, under the influence of French maritime traditions the Naval Officers' School in Gdynia (under Captain Tadeusz Podjazd-Morgenstern) was considered a separate naval base. It used a variety of school ships, including most of the Polish surface vessels.\n\nWar-time organization\nPrior to the outbreak of World War II, on July 10, 1939 the defence of the Polish Pomerania was reorganized into two separate commands under the leadership of Counter Admiral Unrug. The Land Coastal Command (L\u0105dowa Obrona Wybrze\u017ca, also translated as Land Coastal Defence) and Naval Coastal Command (Morska Obrona Wybrze\u017ca, also translated as Naval Coastal Defence) formed the Coastal Defence Group (Grupa Obrony Wybrze\u017ca). They were supported by the Naval Air Squadron (Morski Dywizjon Lotniczy).\n\nLand Coastal Command\nThe Land Coastal Command (L\u0105dowa Obrona Wybrze\u017ca, LOW), subordinate to the Toru\u0144-based military area command led by General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bortnowski, was led by Colonel J\u00f3zef Sass-Hoszowski and, since July 23, by Colonel Stanis\u0142aw D\u0105bek. It was to organize the defence of the Polish seashore, the borders with Nazi Germany and Free City of Danzig, as well as to prepare the defence of the Polish naval bases and the Westerplatte outpost in Danzig.\nAs it was clear that the Polish defenders of the so-called Polish Corridor would be cut off from the Polish mainland, the defence was organized into several fortified lines that were to shield the naval base of Hel Peninsula and the city of Gdynia from all sides, and moved from General Bortnowski command to that of Counter Admiral J\u00f3zef Unrug. The units included:\n\nWejherowo Independent Detachment (Odzia\u0142 Wydzielony Wejherowo; west of Wejherowo) under Lieutenant Colonel Kazimierz Pruszkowski\n1st Marine Rifles Regiment\nPuck National Defence Battalion\nRed\u0142owo Independent Detachment (Odzia\u0142 Wydzielony Red\u0142owo; south of Gdynia) under Lieutenant Colonel Ignacy Szpunar\n2nd Marine Rifles Regiment\n1st Reserve Infantry Battalion\nKartuzy Independent Detachment (Odzia\u0142 Wydzielony Kartuzy) under Captain Marian Mordawski\nGdynia II National Defence battalion\nKartuzy National Defence battalion\nGdynia I National Defence battalion (near Koleczkowo)Altogether, the forces subordinate to Colonel D\u0105bek numbered about 15,000 men.\nSeparate from the Land Coastal Defence were:\n\nthe Hel Fortified Area (Rejon Umocniony Hel, ca. 3,000 men) under Ctr. Adm. W\u0142odzimierz Steyer\nsupported by 4th battalion of the Border Defence Corps;\nWesterplatte garrison (ca. 200 men)The remainder of the Polish forces, including the improvised units, the mobilized Police, Polish Border Guard, Border Defence Corps and the volunteers, were to defend the outskirts of Gdynia and the Oksywie Heights, while the 4th battalion of the Border Defence Corps was to defend Hel. The anti-air defence was provided by the 1st and 2nd battalion of AA artillery, with 14 75 mm guns wz.22/24 and 14 40 mm wz. 38 guns.\n\nNaval Coastal Command\nThe Naval Coastal Command (Morska Obrona Wybrze\u017ca, MOW) included all of the Polish naval vessels, as well as the coastal artillery batteries of Hel and Oksywie. Out of the destroyer flotilla, all but one were withdrawn to Great Britain during the Operation Peking. These included ORP Burza under Lt. Cmdr. Stanis\u0142aw Nahorski, ORP B\u0142yskawica under Lt. Cmdr. W\u0142odzimierz Kodr\u0119bski and ORP Grom under Lt. Cmdr. Aleksander Hulewicz.\nThe only large surface vessels to be left in Poland before the outbreak of hostilities were the heavy minelayer ORP Gryf under Stefan Kwiatkowski (later replaced by Lieutenant Commander Wiktor \u0141omidze) and its escort, the destroyer ORP Wicher under Stefan de Walden.\nThe submarine flotilla was left in Poland with the task of disrupting the enemy movement in the area of the Bay of Gda\u0144sk, as well as to lay mines on the routes from Germany to East Prussian ports in the Operation Worek. Commanded by Lieutenant Commander Adam Mohuczy, the flotilla included:\n\nORP Wilk under Captain Bogus\u0142aw Krawczyk\nORP \u017bbik under Lieutenant Commander Micha\u0142 \u017bebrowski\nORP Ry\u015b under Lieutenant Commander Aleksander Grochowski\nORP S\u0119p under Lieutenant Commander W\u0142adys\u0142aw Salomon\nORP Orze\u0142 under Lieutenant Commander Henryk K\u0142oczkowskiApart from the abovementioned ships, a number of other vessels were left in the Polish naval bases, including several smaller torpedo boats, mine trawlers, minelayers and auxiliary vessels. The Minelayer/Minesweeper Flotilla (Flotylla Minowc\u00f3w) was composed mostly of the so-called birdies (ptaszki, a nickname coined after the fact that all of the Jask\u00f3\u0142ka class ships were named after a different species of non-raptor birds).\n\nORP Czajka\nORP Mewa\nORP Jask\u00f3\u0142ka\nORP Rybitwa\nORP Czapla\nORP \u017burawTwo obsolete gunboats, the ORP Genera\u0142 Haller and ORP Komendant Pi\u0142sudski were grouped in the so-called group of gunboats. Other ships left in the bases of Gdynia and Hel included frogmen support ship ORP Nurek, school artillery ship ORP Mazur and mobilized patrol boat of the Border Guard, ORP Batory.\n\nNaval Air Squadron\nThe Naval Air Squadron (Morski Dywizjon Lotniczy) was composed of two squadrons of seaplanes, both based in Puck and commanded by Lieutenant Commander Edward Szystowski. The squadron consisted of roughly 17 obsolete planes (mostly Lublin R-VIII and Lublin R-XIII Hydro of various versions), three liaison planes (one RWD-14 Czapla and two RWD-17), and a single modern CANT Z.506 Airone, purchased in Italy.\nBoth squadron were to provide reconnaissance for the ships of the Polish Navy, while the fighter cover was to be provided by the organic squadrons of the Army Pomorze fighting in southern Pomerania. However, the Naval Air Squadron was mostly destroyed on the ground on September 1, with its commander being the first Allied naval officer to be killed in action in World War II.\n\nRiverine flotillas\nDuring the Polish-Bolshevik War the Pinsk Marshes in modern Belarus proved to be almost impassable to troops of both sides. Lack of roads and railways posed a serious danger to infantry and cavalry that could easily be cut off both by the enemy and the weather. Because of that, a number of river monitors were either constructed or acquired from private owners and armed. They were used on the Pripiat River, as well as its extensive river basin. After the war, some of the ships were returned to their owners, while the rest remained in active service and were pressed into the so-called Pinsk Flotilla.\nIn peacetime, the Riverine Flotilla of the Polish Navy, as it was officially called, operated on the Pina River, as well as on Pripyat and Strumie\u0144. It served as a mobile reserve of the Border Defence Corps and was to support the front in case of a war with the Soviet Union. Prior to the outbreak of the Polish Defensive War, a number of ships and detachments of the Riverine Flotilla were moved to the Vistula River as a Separated Detachment of the Vistula River (Oddzia\u0142 Wydzielony Rzeki Wis\u0142y), better known as the Vistula Flotilla. During the fight against the Soviets and the Germans, most of the ships were sunk by their crews to avoid capture.\n\nSee also\nBattle of the Danzig Bay\nBattle of Gdynia\nBattle of K\u0119pa Oksywska\nBattle of Hel\nWorek Plan\nOrze\u0142 incident\nPolish River Fleet\nPolish contribution to World War II\n\nReferences\nCristino Castroviejo Vicente (2001). \"The Baltic in Flames: the 1939 naval campaign\".
