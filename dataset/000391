As tensions mounted between China and Imperial Japan in the 1930s, a number of smaller Chinese warlord airforce men and equipment, including those from the Guangdong Provincial Air Force, became integrated into the ROCAF in a centralized effort to counter Imperial Japanese military ambitions.\n\nOperations\nDuring the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), which is often regarded as the beginning of World War II, the ROCAF participated in attacks on Japanese warships on the eastern front and along the Yangtze river and interdiction and close-air support during the Battle of Shanghai in 1937. Chinese sources estimated the Japanese could field approximately 600 aircraft (from a total of 1,530) against China's 230 combat-ready aircraft. As the IJAAF and the IJNAF conducted mass-terror bombings against both civilian and military targets, the Chinese Air Force also planned raiding Japanese home island with the B-10 bomber that was suited for the transoceanic raid. The initial lineup of Chinese frontline fighter aircraft included but not limited to the Curtiss Hawk II, Hawk III, Boeing P-26C/Model 281, Fiat CR.32 among others. These engaged Japanese fighters, attack/bombers and reconnaissance aircraft in many major air battles beginning from 14 August 1937, when Imperial Japanese Navy warplanes raided Jianqiao Airbase (Wades-Gile: \"Chienchiao\" airbase); \"814\" has thus become known as \"Air Force Day\". Chinese Boeing P-26/281 fighters engaged Japanese Mitsubishi A5M fighters in the world's first dogfight between all-metal monoplane fighters. A long-distance \"bombing raid\" into Japan on 19 May 1938 saw two Chinese Martin B-10 bombers led by Captain Xu Huansheng fly a \"raid\" over Japan, albeit bdropping only anti-war leaflets over the Japanese cities of Nagasaki, Saga, Fukuoka, among others cities. It was a war of attrition for the Chinese pilots, as many of their most experienced ace fighter pilots, such as Lieutenant Liu Tsui-kang, Colonel Kao Chih-hang, Yue Yiqin, among others, were lost. Six months into the war, the Chinese Air Force inventory of frontline American Hawk IIs and IIIs and P-26Cs, and various others, were mostly superseded by faster and better armed Polikarpov I-15s and I-16s provided under the Sino-Soviet Treaty, including Soviet volunteer combat aviators, as American support for China's war of resistance against Imperial Japan faded. However, with the Fall of Nanking, the Fall of Wuhan, and the losses at the Battle of South Guangxi, the supply primary supply-line of China's war of resistance against the Imperial Japanese onslaught dealt the war effort a further blow, not least of which the high-octane aviation fuel that was blocked-off from Chinese access, but still accessible to Imperial Japan.After suffering heavy losses in the Battle of Wuhan in October 1938, most active air force units were withdrawn hinterland for the defense of Sichuan against the most massive terror-bombing raids ever inflicted upon civilian populations, with a level of brutality never before seen; the massive Japanese carpet-bombing campaigns were also fiercely contested, sometimes with significant Japanese losses. But as China was not an aviation-industrial power at the time, losses continued to mount, and while the Japanese forces enjoyed a highly-developed aviation industry that saw cutting-edge technological advancements that gave Japanese aircraft distinct performance advantages in speed, agility, altitude/climbing rate and firepower greatly placed the increasing obsolescence of Chinese fighter aircraft burning low-grade fuel at tremendous disadvantage; the Imperial Japanese high-command and military forces had now possessed great confidence in proceeding with the implementation of Operation Z (the attack plan on Pearl Harbor).\n\nThrough attrition and loss of their most experienced fighter pilots in the first half of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Republic of China Air Force suffered much irreversible losses in combat against the Japanese, and by the beginning of 1942 the ROCAF was practically annihilated by Japanese aircraft, particularly due to the introduction of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero. The ROCAF was eventually supplemented with the establishment of the American Volunteer Group (known as the \"Flying Tigers\") with fast and heavily armed and armored Curtiss P-40 Warhawks, deploying dissimilar hit and run tactics, while the remains of the Chinese Air Force modernized and rebuilt its strength each year following Imperial Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, with new commitment and aid from the United States.\ufffc\ufffc \nT\nThe ROC Air Force was reconstituted into seven Groups, one separate Squadron and four Volunteer Groups. In 1939, after the USSR concluded a non-aggression pact with Germany, the Soviet Volunteer Group was withdrawn. By the end of 1941, the air force had 364 operational aircraft. Up to 100 of these were P-40Bs operated by the American Volunteer Group. U.S. replacement aircraft began to arrive in March 1942. They included A-29s, P-40s, P-43s,In 1944, the USAAF Fourteenth Air Force commenced joint operations in the China theatre. By this time the Chinese Air Force was mostly equipped with current operational aircraft types and was superior in all respects to the opposing Japanese air forces which remained.\n\nUnits of the Chinese Airforce 1937\u20131945\n1st Group, (bombers), Tupolev ANT 40 SB III, VI, North American B-25 Mitchell, Northrop Gamma 2E, Northrop A-17\n2nd Group, (bombers), Tupolev ANT 40 SB III, Northrop Gamma 2E, Northrop A-17, 19 Lockheed A-29, 8 Avro 627 China built domestically as scout-bombers at Guangxi\n30th Squadron: 20 Fiat BR.3\n6th Group, (light bombers/scout-bombers), 21 O3U/V-92C, Douglas O-2MC\n7th Group, (light bombers/scout-bombers), 42 O2U Corsair, Douglas O-2MC\n8th Group, (bombers), 2 Northrop Alpha 4 (converted locally to scout-bombers), 30 Ilyushin DB-3 (later into the Composite Group), B-25 Mitchell\n10th Squadron: 10 Savoia-Marchetti S.72, 6 Caproni Ca.111\n19th Squadron: 6 Heinkel He 111,  6 Tupolev TB-3\n30th Squadron: 6 Martin B-10\n12th Group, (bombers)\n10th Squadron, (bombers), 4 Vultee A-19\n3rd Group, (fighters) Fiat CR.30, 9 Avro 626, Polikarpov E.15bis, E.15ter (E.15III, E.153), and E.16, P-40C, P-51D, P-36 Hawk, 36 Gloster Gladiator Mk-1, P-66 Vanguard\n8th Squadron (fighters), 9 Fiat CR.32\n17th Squadron (fighters), 11 Boeing Type 281 (P-26 Peashooter)\n28th Squadron (fighters), Gloster Gladiator Mk-1\n29th Squadron (fighters), Gloster Gladiator Mk-1\n32nd Squadron (fighters), Gloster Gladiator Mk-1\n4th Group, (fighters) Curtiss (Hawk III), Polikarpov E.15bis, E.15ter (E.15III, E.153) and E.16, P-40, 41 P-43 Lancer\n22nd Squadron (fighters): 9 Curtiss 68C Hawk III (F11C-3)\n5th Group, (fighters), Polikarpov E.15bis, E.15ter (E.15III, E.153), P-40N, P-51D, P-66 Vanguard\n17th Squadron (fighters), 12 Dewoitine D.510\n28th Squadron (fighters), 49 Curtiss Hawk-II (F11C-2)\n9th Group, (fighters) 120 Curtiss 68C Hawk III (F11C-3), 20 A-12 Shrike\n26th Squadron A-12 Shrike\n27th Squadron A-12 Shrike\n11th Group, (fighters), P-40N\nRussian Volunteer Group, (pursuit), Polikarpov E.15bis, E.15ter (E.15III, E.153) and E.16\nRussian Volunteer Group, (bombers), Ilyushin DB-3, Polikarpov R-5 Scout-bombers\nAmerican Volunteer Group 'Flying Tigers', (fighters), P-40B, P-40E\nComposite Group\nTemporary Organised Group-Air Cadet Flying School.(Fighter), Curtiss 68C Hawk III (F11C-3)\n12th Squadron (Reconnaissance): 9 P-38/F-5\n13th Squadron (bombers & transports): 3 Savoia-Marchetti SM.81, 1 Spartan Executive Model 7W (lost on Dec 12, 1937).\n14th International Volunteer Squadron (bombers): 20+ Vultee A-19, Northrop Gamma 2E, Northrop A-17, 3 Martin B-10\n15th Squadron (dive bombers): 10 Henschel Hs 123\n18th Squadron (Scout-bombers): Caproni Ca.101 and Douglas O-2MC; originally stationed at Guangdong, later changed to fighters with Curtiss Hawk 75M.\n27th Squadron (light bombers): 9 Bellanca 28-90B\n29th Squadron (fighters): 6 Breda Ba.27\n32nd Squadron (fighters): Nakajima Type 91 fighter\n34th Squadron (fighters and bombers): 14 Armstrong Whitworth Atlas, 6 Westland Wapiti, Mitsubishi Type 92.\n41st French Volunteer Squadron (fighters): 6 Dewoitine D.510\n20 Focke-Wulf Fw 44 of various units\n30+ de Havilland Gipsy Moth of various units, including 13 seaplane versions of Chinese navy.

In addition, there were 37 aircraft transferred to Chinese when Soviet force withdrew from China after the signing of Soviet\u2013German Non-Aggression Pact.  These aircraft included 563 fighters, including 252 I-152, 75 I-153, 132 I-16 Type 10, 75 I-16 Type 17 and rest being I-15 bis, which was not part of the purchase in the 13 batches. Also included were 322 bombers, including 179 SB-2M-100A, 100 SB-2M-103 24 DB-3, 6 TB-3 and 13 SB that were not part of the purchase in the 13 batches). Also included in the 13-batch purchase were 5 UT-1 trainers.  However, of the 250\u2013300 combat aircraft supplied annually, only a few dozen would survive through the end of the year.\n\nUnited States\nWhile the USSR provided most of the military aircraft to Chiang Kai-shek in the late 1930s, many early Chinese aircraft were supplied by the American Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. In 1937 the Hawk II and Hawk III biplanes comprised the backbone of Chinese fighter aviation. These were soon followed by the Hawk 75 monoplane. The demonstration model Hawk 75N, with non-retractable landing gear was purchased in 1938 and became the personal aircraft of the American advisor to the Aviation Committee, Claire Chennault who oversaw training and lobbied for the procurement of American aircraft.\nThe entry of the USA into the war with Japan at the end of 1941 led to the receipt of Lend-Lease equipment from the United States, including aircraft. American Lend-Lease aviation equipment had already begun to arrive in China as early as the middle of 1941, though that includes the first shipments before January 1942 which arrived under the guise of purchases.  Including previously purchased American aircraft, US soon replaced USSR as the largest supplier for the Chinese Nationalist air force during the war (Including the Second Sino-Japanese War that actually broke out in 1931 when Japan invaded Manchuria).\nRetraining on American aircraft occurred for the most part in India. (Karachi and other cities), where Chinese pilots were sent both as groups and as entire units.  As early as the end of 1941 Chinese pilots, mainly recently graduated from flight schools, began to be sent to the US for longer training and mastery of American aircraft.\nThe first American P-43A fighters were received by the 4th Air Group (21st \u2013 24th Squadrons) in March 1942.  They retrained in Kunming, but for the new aircraft the pilots sequentially flew in small groups to India.  On 24 April the deputy commander of the 24th Squadron, Wu Zhenhua, crashed on the flight to Kunming.  On 12 May, Chen Lokun, the flight commander of the 24th Squadron was killed during a training flight, crashing into a tree during landing.  In July for unclear reasons the P-43 of the 4th Air Group commander, Zheng Shaoyu, caught fire in the air and the pilot was killed.  On 3 August 1942 during a training flight the deputy group commander Chen Sheng crashed.  A similar series of crashes accompanied the mastery by the Chinese of almost every new machine.  (It is notable that in Chinese sources the family names are given only of the perished commanders of various ranks, while the losses amongst the line pilots are hardly even noted.) Concluding their conversion to the P-43A in early August 1942, the group returned to Chengdu.\nIn February 1943, preparing for transition to the new American air equipment, the Chinese transferred to India the primary training groups from their flight schools.  Only training for reconnaissance and photography continued to be carried out in China. In March 1945 the cadets completing primary training in India were sent to America to train further.  By that time the number of cadets dispatched had reached 1224, of whom 384 managed to return to China and participate in combat.  In all, from 1942 to 1945 420 training aircraft were sent from the US to China through India, including 20 AT-6, 8 AT-7, 15 AT-17, 150 PT-17, 127 PT-19, 70 PT-22, and 30 BT-13, and also 10 Beechcraft D-17 medical aircraft.\n\nDomestic assembly\nWhile the modified Hawk 75M with retractable landing gear was created specially for China, it was not widely used in the war against the Japanese, in spite of the fact that 30 aircraft, and 82 kits for assembly were delivered in the summer and autumn of 1938. It was planned to assemble the Hawk in a factory operated by the Central Aircraft Manufacturing Company, which had been evacuated from Hankou to Loiwing. The latter location, not far from the Burmese border on the eastern bank of the Ruiluqiang River in Yunnan Province, at that time seemed protected from Japanese attacks, but technical difficulties plagued the actual assembly of the Hawk 75 in that location. Although the Japanese had not bombed the factory, only eight machines were assembled by October 1940. The fate of the remaining kits is unknown.\nFollowing the failure of Hawk 75 production, the CAMCO factory planned to organize assembly of the export version of the Curtiss-Wright CW-21 Demon, light fighter. Three aircraft and 32 sets of components were ordered from the USA. The factory at Loiwing worked until April 1942, when on account of Japanese attacks it had to be evacuated to Kunming, while its American personnel set up shop in India.  From 1943 to 1946 the aircraft factory, which was dispersed in the ravines neighboring Kunming, assembled an experimental series of nine fighter monoplanes, probably from components of the Hawk 75M and 75A-5, and CW-21.  To a degree they were similar to the American prototypes and their further fate is unknown. In western sources the first example figures under the designation Chu X-PO.\n\nSee also\nAerial engagements of the Second Sino-Japanese War\nSoong Mei-ling\nXu Huansheng\n\nReferences\n\nRossi, J.R. \"AVG American Volunteer Group - Flying Tigers\".Bibliography"}
