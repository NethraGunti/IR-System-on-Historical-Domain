It allegedly secretly researched biological warfare and other topics through human experimentation during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945) and World War II era. It was formed in Guangzhou in 1939, and headquartered at Sun Yat-sen University of Medical Sciences (Hal Gold, Unit 731 Testimony, 2003, p. 50).\nThe unit was commanded by Major General Sato Shunji, a physician.  It was staffed by a total of 800 personnel: 100 commissioned officers (many with medical or scientific backgrounds), 200 medical and scientific researchers, and 500 soldiers and noncommissioned officers.\n\nIn 1994, an international research team confirmed the existence of the unit and collected testimony from former members and victims. Shigeru Maruyama, a former member of the unit said that one experiment involved starving prisoners to death and talked of seeing victims being operated on almost every day.\n\nSee also\nKempeitai Political Department and Epidemic Prevention Research Laboratory\n\n\n== References =="}
