The figures for brigades are based on official Polish Army instructions prepared in late 1930s. The numbers in brackets give the figures for a four-regiment brigade, as opposed to the standard three-regiment one. The figures for the regiments are given after the actual mobilisation report of September 1, 1939, of the 25th Greater Polish Uhlans Regiment. Note that the numbers for other units may vary, mostly due to different mobilisation schedules and other problems.\n\nPolish cavalry brigades in 1939\nCavalry\nKrak\u00f3w Cavalry Brigade (Krak\u00f3w) - under Brigadier General Zygmunt Piasecki\nKresowa Cavalry Brigade (Brody) - under Colonel Stefan Hanka-Kulesza\nMazowiecka Cavalry Brigade (Warsaw) under Colonel Jan Karcz\nNowogr\u00f3dzka Cavalry Brigade (Baranowicze) under Brigadier General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders\nPodlaska Cavalry Brigade (Bia\u0142ystok) under Brigadier General Ludwik Kmicic-Skrzy\u0144ski\nPodolska Cavalry Brigade (Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w) under Colonel Leon Strzelecki\nPomeranian Cavalry Brigade (Bydgoszcz) under Colonel Adam Zakrzewski\nSuwalska Cavalry Brigade (Suwa\u0142ki) under Brigadier General Zygmunt Podhorski\nWielkopolska Cavalry Brigade (Pozna\u0144) under Brigadier General Roman Abraham\nWile\u0144ska Cavalry Brigade (Wilno) under Colonel Konstanty Drucki-Lubecki\nWo\u0142y\u0144ska Cavalry Brigade (R\u00f3wne) under Colonel Julian Filipowicz\n\nArmoured-Motorised Brigades\nDifferent armament and structure10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade (Poland) (Rzesz\u00f3w) - dow\u00f3dca: p\u0142k dypl.
