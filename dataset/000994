He was born in Tsuruoka, Yamagata Prefecture. A graduate of Sophia University, where he obtained his Master\u2019s degree, he completed his doctorate at University of M\u00fcnster in 1958. Two volumes of autobiography on his years in Germany narrate his varied experiences during this period. Returning to his alma mater, he became successively lecturer, assistant professor and full professor, until his retirement. He served as emeritus professor at the same university until his death. A passionate book-collector, he was chairman of the Japan Bibliophile Society. His personal collection of books on English philology (see Bibliography) was perhaps his most important contribution to the field of English philology in Japan, containing many rare items.\n\nHistorical revisionism\nA conservative opinion-leader affiliated to the openly revisionist organization Nippon Kaigi, Watanabe was known for his dismissal of the Nanking Massacre as a historical delusion, attributing the known killings to the standard revenge of regular soldiers in war against guerrilla combatants whom they have captured. As he later clarified, in his view, the concept of massacre in war should properly be reserved for atrocities against a civilian population, where the numbers roughly exceed the range of 40\u201350 victims, as opposed to the wholesale killing of irregular insurgents. Generally Watanabe's perspective closely echoes the line taken by Japanese generals before the International Military Tribunal for the Far East in the Tokyo War Crimes Trial of 1948.\nAgain, with regard to the Japanese history textbook controversies, which followed on Saburo Ienaga's suit against the Japanese Education Ministry, Watanabe was almost alone in controverting the general consensus of editorialists writing for the Japanese mainstream press (Mainichi Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun), and upholding the Ministry's prerogative to intervene directly in the content of textbooks used in Japanese primary and secondary schools.In Watanabe's view, the decisive incident leading to Japan's full-scale war on the Chinese mainland, namely the Marco Polo Bridge Incident in 1937, is to be read as an underhand Chinese Communist Party plot against Japan, and the versions of history taught in pre-war Japanese school textbooks are more reliable than those available today to students.Watanabe remained a controversial figure, but predominantly on the Japanese scene. He was little known abroad, even in his own academic area of specialization. He disconcerted foreigners by telling them that Japan's \"racial purity\" was to be cherished.  His prolific writings include a number of books on the \"Japanese spirit\".\nHata Ikuhiko has claimed that Watanabe's book on the German General Staff is characterized by wholesale plagiarism from a German source.\n\nCritics\nBooks criticizing Watanabe include:\n\nIkuhiko Hata (\u79e6\u90c1\u5f66), Nanking jiken\u2015\u2015\u300cgyakusatsu\u300dno k\u014dz\u014d (\u5357\u4eac\u4e8b\u4ef6 \u2014\u300c\u8650\u6bba\u300d\u306e\u69cb\u9020), Ch\u016b\u014d K\u014dronsha (\u4e2d\u592e\u516c\u8ad6\u793e), Tokyo 1986\nSh\u014dwa-shi no nazo o ou, 2 vols. by Bungei Shunj\u016b, Tokyo 1993/1999\nRoy Andrew Miller, The Japanese Language in Contemporary Japan:Some sociolinguistic observationsAEI-Hoover Policy Studies,22, 1977 pp. 9ff.\nPeter Nicholas Dale, The Myth of Japanese Uniqueness, Croom Helm, Oxford and London 1986 pp. 63\u201364,82-88\n\nBibliography\nNihonshi kara mita nihonjin (\u65e5\u672c\u53f2\u304b\u3089\u898b\u305f\u65e5\u672c\u4eba), Sangy\u014d N\u014dritsu Tanki Daigaku Shuppan (\u7523\u696d\u80fd\u7387\u77ed\u671f\u5927\u5b66\u51fa\u7248), 1973\nNihongo no kokoro (\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306e\u5fc3), K\u014ddansha Gendai Shinsho (\u8b1b\u8ac7\u793e\u73fe\u4ee3\u65b0\u66f8), Tokyo 1974\nChiteki seikatsu no h\u014dh\u014d (\u77e5\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5), K\u014ddansha Gendai Shinsho (\u8b1b\u8ac7\u793e\u73fe\u4ee3\u65b0\u66f8), Tokyo 1976\nKokugo no ideorog\u012b (\u56fd\u8a9e\u306e\u30a4\u30c7\u30aa\u30ed\u30ae\u30fc), Ch\u016b\u014d K\u014dronsha (\u4e2d\u592e\u516c\u8ad6\u793e), Tokyo 1977\nSeigi no jidai (\u6b63\u7fa9\u306e\u6642\u4ee3), Bungei Shunj\u016b (\u6587\u85dd\u6625\u79cb), Tokyo 1977\n\u300cNihonrashisa\u300dno k\u014dz\u014d (\u300c\u65e5\u672c\u3089\u3057\u3055\u300d\u306e\u69cb\u9020), K\u014ddansha Gakujutsu Bunko (\u8b1b\u8ac7\u793e\u5b66\u8853\u6587\u5eab), 1977\nZoku-Nihonshi kara mita nihonjin (\u7d9a\u30fb\u65e5\u672c\u53f2\u304b\u3089\u898b\u305f\u65e5\u672c\u4eba), Sangy\u014d N\u014dritsu Tanki Daigaku Shuppan (\u7523\u696d\u80fd\u7387\u77ed\u671f\u5927\u5b66\u51fa\u7248),1977\nBunka no jidai (\u6587\u5316\u306e\u6642\u4ee3), Bungei Shunj\u016b (\u6587\u85dd\u6625\u79cb), Tokyo 1978\nZoku-Chiteki seikatsu no h\u014dh\u014d (\u7d9a\u30fb\u77e5\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\u306e\u65b9\u6cd5), K\u014ddansha Gendai Shinsho (\u8b1b\u8ac7\u793e\u73fe\u4ee3\u65b0\u66f8), Tokyo 1979\nNihon, soshite nihonjin (\u65e5\u672c \u305d\u3057\u3066\u65e5\u672c\u4eba), Sh\u014ddensha NON book (\u7965\u4f1d\u793e\u30ce\u30f3\u30fb\u30d6\u30c3\u30af), Tokyo, 1980\nThe Peasant Soul of Japan, Palgrave Macmillan, London 1989\nDoitsu ry\u016bgakki (\u30c9\u30a4\u30c4\u7559\u5b66\u8a18), K\u014ddansha Gendai Shinsho, Tokyo 1980, 2 vols.\nBibliotheca Philologica Watanabeiensis: The Catalogue of Philological Books in the Library of Professor Shoichi Watanabe.
