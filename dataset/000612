He was also appointed president of Lianhua Shubao (\u806f\u83ef\u66f8\u5831) and general editor of People's Tribune.\nIn 1931, Zhou Enlai who managed the central leading authority of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai, was pressured heavily by the Kuomintang. At that time, T'ang hid Zhou from the Kuomintang authorities, and with the assistance of a Western friend, enabled Zhou's escape from Shanghai.In 1933, T'ang was appointed as an adviser to the Foreign Ministry, National Government, with minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary status. After that he became a general editor of The China Today Series and the English Encyclopedia of Modern China.

Among these are, The New Currency System in China (1937), which was referred to by Milton Friedman.\n\nIn the Wang Jingwei regime\nIn March 1940, when the Wang Jingwei regime was established, T'ang assumed formal office in the regime. In August of the same year, he was appointed director of the International Publicity Bureau (\u570b\u969b\u5ba3\u50b3\u5c40\u5c40\u9577), remaining at this post until the collapse of the regime following Japan's surrender in 1945. From May to August 1941 he also held the post of Policy Affairs Vice-Minister for the Foreign Affairs Ministry.\nAfter the Wang Jingwei regime had collapsed, T'ang was arrested by Chiang Kai-shek's National Government; however, for unknown reasons, he was soon released. In 1949, he returned to Indonesia and lived in Jakarta. He participated in editing The Indonesian Review of International Affairs, and was interviewed by Japanese political scientist Tatsuo Yamada (who specialized in Chinese politics) on December 17, 1969.\nT'ang Leang-Li died in 1970.\n\nWorks\nChina in Revolt (London, 1927.
