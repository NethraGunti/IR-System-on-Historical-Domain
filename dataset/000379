The agreement was made between Kwantung Army negotiator, Kenji Doihara, representing Japan, and Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang 29th Army, General Qin Dechun (Chin Techun), representing China. It resulted in the demilitarisation of Chahar.\nAs a result of the Chin\u2013Doihara Agreement it was agreed:\n1.) The commander of the regiment that detained the Japanese soldiers and the judge advocate of the division concerned were to be dismissed and punished.\n2.) All units of the Chinese 29th Army were to be withdrawn from the districts of Chahar province north of Changpei.\n3.) Maintenance of peace and order there was to be entrusted to the Peace Preservation Corps of Chahar Province.\n4.) No Chinese were to be permitted to migrate to and settle in the northern part of Chahar province in the future.\n5.) No activities of the Kuomintang were to be permitted in Chahar province.\n6.) All anti-Japanese institutions and acts were to be banned in Chahar province.As a result of the Agreement, Qin became head of the Chahar Provisional Government.As with the previous He-Umezu Agreement which gave Japan virtual control over the province of Hebei, the Chin\u2013Doihara Agreement was a first step in the establishment of Japanese control over northern China and Inner Mongolia. The Agreement resulted in considerable anti-Japanese sentiment in China and was one of the causes of the December 9th Movement at the end of 1935.\n\nSee also\nSecond Sino-Japanese War\n\nNotes\nReferences\nBisson, T.A.
