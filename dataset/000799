In 1948 he moved to Sakata, Yamagata. He graduated from Musashino Art School (\u6b66\u8535\u91ce\u7f8e\u8853\u5b66\u6821, Musashino Bijutsu Gakk\u014d) (now Musashino Art University) in 1960, and set up a design company in which he was an art director, but became a freelance in 1970. He worked as a fashion photographer in Paris from 1973 to 1976. In 1980 he met his parents, from whom he had been separated, and started work on a photographic contribution to the effort of reuniting Japanese war orphans and their biological parents. This work branched into the photography of people of Japanese descent in Hawai'i and South America.A Portrait of Japanese Immigrants to South America won the Domon Ken Award in 1986; Aramasa subsequently won various other awards.Aramasa has taught at Musashino Art University from 1993.\n\nExhibitions\n\"A Portrait of Japanese Immigrants to South  America,\" Yurakucho Marion, Tokyo, 1986\n\"A Portrait of Japanese Immigrants to South  America,\" Hiroshima and Osaka, Japan, 1987\n\"Taku Aramasa Photographs-The 80th Anniversary  of Japanese Immigration to Brazil,\" S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Modern Art, S\u00e3o Paulo, 1988\n\"Family, Commemorative Exhibition of 'Who Am  I',\" Nikon Salon, Tokyo and Osaka, 1990\n\"Who Am I?- War Orphans Left in China,\" Tokyo Metropolitan Art Gallery, Tokyo, 1991\n\"Who Am I?- War Orphans Left in China,\" Hiroshima and Fukuoka, Japan, 1992\n\"Taku Aramasa Photographs: Portraits of Native America,\" Yuraku-cho Art Forum, Tokyo, Hakata, Nara and Takaoka, Japan, 1994\n\"Silent Land-Prison Camps in Siberia,\" Sinjuku Park Tower Gallery 1, Tokyo, 1995\n\"Manchuria/Siberia,\" Kawasaki City Museum, Kawasaki, Japan, 1996\n\"Silent Land-Prison Camps in Siberia,\" Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography, Tokyo, 1997\n\"Aramasa Taku Photographs-America/Promised Land,\" Mitsumura Art Plaza, Tokyo, 2000\n\"11+1 Photographs,\" Musashino Art University, Department of Imaging Arts 10th Anniversary, Mitsumura Art Plaza, Tokyo, 2000\n\"Aramasa Taku Photographs: Portraits of Japanese Immigrants,\" Polaroid Gallery, Tokyo, 2001\n\"Only Skin Deep-Changing vision of the American self,\" International Center of Photography, New York, NY\n\"Aramasa Taku-Sakura,\" Stephen Wirtz Gallery, San Francisco California, 2005\n\"Aramasa Taku Photographs-Apocalypse,\" Museum of Musashino Art University, Tokyo, 2006\n\"Aramasa Taku Photographs-America/promised Land\" (platinum prints) Gallery Out of Place, Nara Japan, 2008\n\"Aramasa Sakura,\"  Nikon Salon, Tokyo and Osaka, 2008\n\uff62frame & vision\uff63 -blessing in forest- ARAMASA Taku Solo Exhibition Tokyo Gallery+BTAP, 2009\n\"ARAMASA Taku Photographs 2011\"(Na2 Platina print) One Men Show, OUT of PLACE, Nara, 2011\n\"ARAMASA Taku 2012 -HRIZON-\" One Men Show, Tokyo Publishing House,Tokyo, 2012\n\"ARAMASA Taku 2014 -HRIZON-\" One Men Show,  Annely Juda Fine Art, London, 2014\n\nAwards\n28th New Artist of the Year Award, Japan Photography Association, 1978\nGrand Prize (Public Poster) at  the 1st International Triennale Toyama, 1985\nthe 5th Domon Ken Award, 1986\nthe 10th Higashikawa Award, 1994\nthe 46th Artist of the Year Award, Japan Photography Association, 1996\n\nCollections\nCenter for Creative Photography, University of Arizona, Arizona\nDomon Ken Memorial Hall, Sakata, Japan\nHigashikawa Museum, Higashikawa-cho, Hokkaido, Japan\nS\u00e3o Paulo Museum, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nHistory Museum of Japanese Immigrants, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nInternational Center of Photography, New York, New York\nOsaka Human Rights History Museum, Osaka, Japan\nSan Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, California\nHistory Museum of Japanese Immigrants, San Jose, California\nTokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography, Tokyo, Japan\nStephen Wirtz Gallery, San Francisco, California\nGallery Out of Place, Nara, Japan\nMuseum of Musashino Art University, Tokyo, Japan\n\nBooks\nBooks by Aramasa\nGyakk\u014d sango sh\u014d (\u9006\u5149\u30b5\u30f3\u30b4\u7901).
