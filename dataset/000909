After the Japanese established the puppet state of Manchukuo, the privately owned railways in the territory of Manchukuo were nationalised to create the Manchukuo National Railway, which designated these the Mikai (\u30df\u30ab\u30a4) class, becoming Mikana (\u30df\u30ab\u30ca) class after the classification reform of 1938.\nAfter the end of the Pacific War, these locomotives were passed on to the Republic of China Railway. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, China Railways designated them \u3107\u310e18 (MK18) class in 1951. They were subsequently redesignated \u89e3\u653e18 (JF18) class in 1959, and were retired in 1975.\n\n\n== References =="}
