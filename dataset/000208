It was created by order of Marshal Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y, on September 10, 1939.\n\nBackground\nThe Northern Front was one of two fronts (see Polish Southern Front), created to coordinate the activities of armies fighting the advancing Wehrmacht. According to Polish military planners, the Front was to be created out of units which had retreated southwards, after defending the border with East Prussia, and reserve units, concentrated east of Warsaw. The Front was supposed to defend the line of the Narew river, but this was already impossible on September 10, the day of its creation. Another line of defence, along the Bug river, also was impossible to hold, as units of the Northern Front were scattered after heavy fighting against the Germans. The Modlin Army had withdrawn to the Modlin Fortress, while Independent Operational Group Narew had been broken into a number of smaller groups. The Prusy Army, destroyed near Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski and Radom, was slowly recreated in the area of Che\u0142m.\n\nOrganization\nThe Front was commanded by General Stefan D\u0105b-Biernacki, its quartermaster was Colonel Tadeusz Procner.\n\nElements of Lublin Army\n39th Infantry Division\n\nElements of Operational Group Wyszk\u00f3w\n1st Legions Infantry Division,\n41st Infantry Division\n\nElements of Independent Operational Group Narew\n33rd Infantry Division\n\nGeneral W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders Operational Group of Cavalry\nNowogr\u00f3dzka Cavalry Brigade,\nparts of Mazowiecka Cavalry Brigade,\nparts of Wo\u0142y\u0144ska Cavalry Brigade\nparts of Kresowa Cavalry Brigade,\nColonel Adam Zakrzewski Cavalry Brigade.\n\nActions\nThe Northern Front for the first time got in contact with the enemy in the night of September 16/17, 1939, when Wehrmacht units, advancing from Brzesc nad Bugiem, reached the town of W\u0142odawa. Polish forces were unable to recapture the town, but they stopped the enemy advance towards Che\u0142m.\nAfter news of the Soviet invasion of Poland reached General Dab Biernacki and his officers, all units of the Northern Front were ordered to march southwards, to the area of Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski, to join Krak\u00f3w Army and Lublin Army. All Polish forces tried to fight their way to Lw\u00f3w and the Romanian Bridgehead. The Wehrmacht, well aware of it, tried to halt Polish advance in the Battle of Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski.\nThe second battle of Tomasz\u00f3w ended in Polish failure. Very few soldiers and officers managed to flee southwards, facing not only the Wehrmacht, but also the Red Army, which had invaded eastern Poland on September 17.\nSome weak units had remained in the area of Che\u0142m until September 25, when they retreated towards Kra\u015bnik. These forces capitulated on September 26, after realizing that it was impossible to cross the heavily guarded San river.\n\nSources\nJurga T., U kresu II Rzeczypospolitej, Ksi\u0105\u017cka i Wiedza 1985, ISBN 83-05-11669-7\nKazimierz Sobczak [red.]: Encyklopedia II wojny Swiatowej.
