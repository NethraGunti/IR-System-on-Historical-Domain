The book is a collection of analytical thinking stories written by Wa\u0144kowicz in the early 1940s, while the author was in exile. Following the invasion of Poland, he left the country in late September 1939 for Romania, later moving to Cyprus, BritishPalestine, Italy, and finally, to London. Wrzesie\u0144 \u017cagwi\u0105cy gives a vivid account of the Polish September Campaign; its title refers to the fact that Nazi Germany, together with the Soviet Union invaded the Second Polish Republic jointly in September 1939. The book was first published in 1947, in London, by Gryf Publishing House. It was reprinted in 1990 by Polonia Publishing House, while several stories from the book were printed separately, with the most popular one, Westerplatte, having been printed in 1959, 1960, 1963, 1967, 1968, 1971, 1989, and 1990. In August 2009, Warsaw publishing house Pr\u00f3szy\u0144ski i Sp\u00f3\u0142ka reprinted the book in the third volume of collected works by Wa\u0144kowicz. In this volume, Wrzesie\u0144 \u017cagwi\u0105cy is published together with other war-related stories, such as Strz\u0119py epopei, Szpital w Cichiniczach, and Po kl\u0119sce.The introduction to the 2009 volume was written by Tadeusz Pawe\u0142 Rutkowski, historian of the University of Warsaw. Rutkowski wrote that Wa\u0144kowicz collected stories of the September Campaign \"on the spot, planning to publish them in the press (...) After crossing the Romanian border, he faced a general chaos and bitterness of the lost war. For the Polish nation, the speed of German units, their advancement in armour and airforce, and the panic evacuation of Polish authorities, were a complete shock (...) Wrzesie\u0144 \u017cagwi\u0105cy was written to present heroism of the Polish soldier, and to show the world that the invasion was not an easy walk for the Germans. Polish troops were eager to fight, but were defeated by numerical and technological superiority of the enemy (...) New stories were added to the book throughout the war. Wrzesie\u0144... is full of emotions, not always factually accurate and spiked with statistical errors, yet authentic and direct (...) Wa\u0144kowicz presents people who kept on fighting aware of hopelessness of their position. He describes the country which was attacked by two enemies, with soldiers trying to reach southern border, between the Wehrmacht in the west, and the Red Army in the east. The detailed description of fighting sometimes is far from reality, which was the result of Wa\u0144kowicz's inability to confront stories told by different people. Therefore, the description of the Battle of Westerplatte, based mainly on the account of Mayor Henryk Sucharski, diverges from historical works (...) It is a paradox that the book, written for immediate publication as an answer to German propaganda, did not accomplish its task. Its author, banned by the government of W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski for his pre-war affiliations, did not receive permission for the publication. As a complete book, it was not published until 1947, reaching a narrow circle of readers. In the People's Republic of Poland, Wrzesie\u0144 \u017cagwi\u0105cy was never published in its complete form. Communist censorship accepted the chapters about Westerplatte and Major Dobrza\u0144ski, but descriptions of Soviet invasion and fighting with the Red Army were not available for Polish readers until 1990\".\n\nPublication history\nWrzesie\u0144 \u017cagwi\u0105cy was based on the author's 1943 collection of reportages, published in British Palestine in 1943 during the Mediterranean Campaign. It was titled Wrze\u015bniowym szlakiem. Wa\u0144kowicz wrote it under pen name Jerzy \u0141u\u017cyc. In 1947, after coming to London, Wa\u0144kowicz expanded Wrze\u015bniowym szlakiem, adding new stories, and changing the name of the publication into Wrzesie\u0144 \u017cagwi\u0105cy. As the author claimed, most of his reportages had been written in the final months of 1939, and were based on personal interviews with soldiers of the Polish Army and Polish civil servants, who witnessed or fought in the Invasion of Poland. Due to his work, the defenders of Westerplatte, and Major Henryk Dobrza\u0144ski became legendary figures in Polish historiography. Nevertheless, Wrzesie\u0144 \u017cagwi\u0105cy should not be considered a history books, as in some cases Wa\u0144kowicz's interlocutors did not give truthful testimonies. Among others, in August 1946 in Italy, Wa\u0144kowicz interviewed Major Henryk Sucharski, who did not mention the fact that in the first days of the Battle of Westerplatte, he suffered a nervous breakdown, and the defence was commanded by Captain Franciszek D\u0105browski.In the 1947 foreword, Wa\u0144kowicz writes: \"Most of this book was written in 1939, to give testimony to our fighting. At that time, everything that the world knew about September, came from our enemies, who spread lies about the campaign that lasted only for eighteen days. The world wondered why small Finland defended itself for so long. That is why I wrote the book in a hurry, without sources, with one target - to show Polish fighting spirit. So, my book is not a report about the war itself, but rather about Polish spirit in September 1939 (...) Loose pages wandered with me across the world, and when in 1943 I finally had the chance to publish the stories, several were missing (...) Currently, when so many people from oflags, gulags and Poland joined us, the need for re-publishing the book for Poles in England has arisen. I am adding Westerplatte, the story of General Tadeusz Kutrzeba's airforce, and the story of Major Hubal.\"\n\nChapters\nDywersja niemiecka w Polsce (German Subversion in Poland)\nThe activities of the pro-German fifth column began in the Second Polish Republic right after World War One. Several German organizations operated in the 1920s and 1930s, including the Deutsche Arbeitspartei, the Jugendbund, and the Volks Bund, headed by Hans Glodny, a man who had a Polish father and a German mother. Following the Great Crisis, unemployment in Poland was widespread, especially in Polish part of Upper Silesia, whose mines produced more coal than Poland needed. German propaganda took advantage of this, telling Silesians that Polish rule took away their jobs, and promising that after the return of Upper Silesia to Germany, new posts would be created. \n\nOkres \"przyja\u017ani\" polsko-niemieckiej (The Period of Polish-German \"Friendship\")Following the 1934 German\u2013Polish Non-Aggression Pact, several legal German associations were opened in Poland, such as the Jungdeutsche Partei, created by engineer Wiesner from Bielsko-Bia\u0142a. Upon orders of Rudolf Hess, military sabotage was under preparation, with members of the German minority being sent to the Third Reich for training. Meanwhile, Hitler reduces unemployment, and German enterprises need workers. Polish citizens are often employed, but on the condition that they join German organizations, and their children attend German schools. Training for saboteurs is organized in the town of Leobschutz, where participants learn how to use guns and grenades.Tu\u017c przed wojn\u0105 (Right Before the War)\nWybuch wojny (The Outbreak of War)\n\nPierwsze trzy dni wojny w Gda\u0144sku (First Three Days of War in Gda\u0144sk)\nZostaj\u0105 (They Are Staying)\n\"Go\u015bcie\" przechodz\u0105 przez most (The \"Guests\" are Crossing the Bridge)\nImmunitet (Immunity)\nZemsta (The Revenge)\nTortury I morderstwa (Tortures and Murders)\nWyzwolenie (Release)\n\nWesterplatte\nTe pierwsze walki (The First Fights)\nPierwsze czo\u0142gi (First Tanks)\nPierwsza gorycz (First Bitterness)\nW opa\u0142ach (In Trouble)\nObrona mostu (Defence of a Bridge)\n\nDzieje kompanii saperskiej (The History of a Company of Sappers)\nJeszcze stawiam pod karabin (I am Still Standing by a Gun)\nMasakra w lesie (A Massacre in a Forest)\nBia\u0142e r\u0119kawiczki (White Gloves)\nJak zaj\u0105c w kotle (Like a Hare in a Cauldron)\nPono\u0107 nasi bij\u0105 w tarabany (Apparently, Our Boys are Beating the Drums)\nOdwet niemiecki (German Retaliation)\nCmentarzysko broni (A Cemetery of Weapons)\n\nJ\u0119drek, Witek, i ich tysi\u0105ce (J\u0119drek, Witek, and the Thousands of Them)\nOpowiadanie Witka (Witek's Story)\nWalka pod Kamionk\u0105 Strumi\u0142ow\u0105 (The Battle of Kamionka Strumi\u0142owa)\nHej!
