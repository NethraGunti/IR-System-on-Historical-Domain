After the Japanese Empire invaded Manchuria and established Manchukuo, a new system was established under the control of Japan.  A central police department was established to be responsible for all police in Manchuria.\nIn each province, police headquarters were set up, like Xinjing's Metropolitan Police Office and the Fengtian City Police.\nA Maritime Police was also set up to combat smuggling.\n\nHistory\nMarch 1932:the Manchukuo Police Forces were established.\nJune 1932:the Xinjing Metropolitan Police Department was established.\nMarch 1934:Puyi was formally declared as Emperor.\nMarch 1937:the Manchukuo Police were put under the authority of the Manchukuo Ministry of Public Security.\nDecember 1937:Extraterritoriality over Japan is abolished.\nDecember 1939:A police code of conduct is enacted.\nOctober 1943:\"General Directorate of Security Affairs\" is established to replace the Manchukuo Ministry of Public Security.\nAugust 1945:Manchukuo Police was dissolved.\n\nPolice Code\nIn December 1939, the Manchukuo Police Code of Conduct was established as a code of conduct for all police officers .\n\nPolice officers should be the forerunners of the Kingly Way.\nPolice officers should be the core of national harmony.\nPolice officers must be men of valor and uphold justice.\nPolice officers must be disciplined and harmonious.\nPolice officers are supposed to act with integrity and responsibility\nPolice officers should be honourable,impartial, and selfless.\nPolice officers should strive to self-improve their personalities.\n\nMaritime Police\nAs a subordinate organization of the Manchukuo Police, its main task was to crack down on smuggling and maintain maritime security. Although the name of the police force is used, the Imperial Japanese Navy were deeply involved since the very beginning and trained its officers. During the middle of World War II, the Japanese Navy took over the cost of the transport of goods. In addition, half of the maritime police officers were Japanese seconded from the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n\nHistorical background\nBefore the establishment of Manchukuo, the naval force of the Fengtian Clique was called the Northeast Fleet and possessed a total of 21 ships.\nHowever, after the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, the Northeast Fleet fled to the Nanjing Nationalist Government. There was virtually no organization to guard the territorial waters of the Bohai and Yellow seas.\nAfter the establishment of Manchukuo, the government  decided to establish a maritime police agency with the cooperation of the Japanese Navy (the naval department in Manchuria), and a coastal surveillance police unit was established.\nIn 1932, the Coast Guard Police Force was renamed the Coastal Police Force in accordance with the \"Special Police Force Officer System\" (Order No. 33 of the Kangde 1). Later, in 1938, the first stage of the plan was formulated, and the construction and purchase of new vessels was promoted. The headquarters was set up in Yingkou.\nIn 1937, the special police force officer system was abolished and the coastal police force was reorganized into a new marine police force.\nIn 1938 (Kangde 5), the maritime police were transferred to the coastal counties.\n\nOrganization\nAs of 1943 (10th year of Kangde):\n\nPolice HQ\nPolice, Security, Education, Personnel, Secret Service, Management and Administration.\nDepartment of Shipping\nShip administration, machinery administration\nAviation Unit\nGuard ship Unit\nTraining Unit\nKoro Island Wireless Telegraph Station\nDaito Wireless Telegraph Station\nShogawa Wireless Telegraph Office\n\nRanks\nUniforms\nReferences\n\u6e80\u5dde\u56fd\u6c11\u653f\u90e8\u8b66\u52d9\u53f8\u300e\u6e80\u5dde\u56fd\u8b66\u5bdf\u6982\u8981\u300f(\u5eb7\u5fb32\u5e7410\u6708) \u30a2\u30b8\u30a2\u6b74\u53f2\u8cc7\u6599\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc \u30ec\u30d5\u30a1\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9:A05020355600\n\u6e80\u5dde\u56fd\u6cbb\u5b89\u90e8\u8b66\u52d9\u53f8\u300e\u6e80\u5dde\u56fd\u8b66\u5bdf\u6982\u8981\u300f(\u5eb7\u5fb37\u5e7411\u6708) \u30a2\u30b8\u30a2\u6b74\u53f2\u8cc7\u6599\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u30ec\u30d5\u30a1\u30ec\u30f3\u30b9\u30b3\u30fc\u30c9:A05020355400\\"}
