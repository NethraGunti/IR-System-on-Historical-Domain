Today it accommodates the \u201cJohn Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall\u201d and the \u201cJohn Rabe Research and Exchange Centre for Peace and Reconciliation.\u201d\nThe John Rabe House is located in the center of Nanjing, at southeast corner of Gulou campus of Nanjing University. John Rabe, former Siemens China Representative and Chairman of the International Committee for the Nanking Safety Zone, resided there from 1932 to 1938. It was also in this house where he wrote the famous \u201cDiaries of John Rabe\u201d.\nFor almost half a century, Rabe's former residence in Nanking (as it was spelled then) received little recognition until its location was publicized by the publication of Rabe's diaries  in December 1996 by his granddaughter Ursula Reinhardt. When German president Johannes Rau visited Nanjing University in 2003, he expressed concern about the dilapidated condition of John Rabe\u2019s former residence. After Rau\u2019s visit and with his great encouragement to renovate the house, the project kicked off successfully in 2005. The Consulate General of the Federal Republic of Germany in Shanghai, together with Siemens Ltd. China, Bosch-Siemens Home Appliances signed an agreement with Nanjing University to renovate the house and construct the \u201cJohn Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall\u201d and \u201cJohn Rabe Research and Exchange Centre for Peace and Reconciliation.\u201d The German side was to provide financing while Nanjing University was responsible for the renovation and maintenance of the John Rabe House as well as for the establishment and management of the Memorial Hall and Research Center.\n\nJohn Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall\nOn October 31, 2006, the \u201cJohn Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall\u201d officially opened to the public. On 1628 square meters, 6 exhibition areas, more than 300 photographs, files and historical material tell Rabe\u2019s life story. Its main focus is to commemorate the efforts of John Rabe and the other members of the Nanking Safety Zone to save innocent lives during the Nanking Massacre. The Memorial Hall in Rabe\u2019s former residence can be visited Monday \u2013 Friday from 8:30 to 16:30. Since 2008, the Austrian Service Abroad has been sending a Peace Servant to work at the Memorial Hall and Exchange Center for one year.\n\nSee also\nJohn Rabe\nNanking Massacre\nNanking Safety Zone\nThe Good Man of Nanking\nThe International Committee for Nanking Safety Zone\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\"Homepage of the John Rabe and International Safety Zone Memorial Hall\".
