She was the granddaughter of General Hideki T\u014dj\u014d, the Japanese wartime prime minister who was convicted as a Class A war criminal and hanged after World War II in 1948.\n\nPolitics\nIn May 2007, Tojo revealed her intention to run in the House of Councillors election at the age of 68. She ran on a far-right platform. Tojo denied Japanese war crimes during World War II.\nTojo was a patron of The Truth about Nanjing, a movie made with the intention to expose what the filmaker Satoru Mizushima saw as propagandistic aspects of the Nanjing Massacre. Mizushima claims that the 1937 Nanking Massacre was a politically motivated fabrication by China and numerous western eyewitnesses.Japan's nationalists including former Prime Minister Shinz\u014d Abe, have distanced themselves from her. Political commentator Minoru Morita has said of her, \u201cTojo\u2019s nationalistic attitude might appeal to certain elements of the population, but most Japanese do not sympathize with her views. She has no chance at all at the elections,\"\n\nDeath\nTojo died on February 13, 2013 at the age of 73, ten years after her entry into politics.\n\nQuotes\n\"Japan did not fight a war of aggression. It fought in self-defense. Our children have been wrongly taught that their ancestors did evil things, that their country is evil. We need to give these children back their pride and confidence\".\"In Japan, there are no war criminals. Every one of those enshrined at Yasukuni died fighting for their country, and we should honor them\".\"Many people, including Kyuma, believe that the atomic bombs stopped Japan's 'aggression,' but Japan did not fight a war of aggression,\" said Tojo, who claimed the war was fought to liberate the \"nonwhite\" colonies in Asia from the \"whites\". \"If there was one mistake, however, it was the fact that we lost. And if my grandfather is to blame, it's not because he started the war but because we lost\". Quoted in an article by the Japan Times, written by Setsuko Kamiya on July 11, 2007.\"People think I'm a hawk, but I'm actually a dove on the torii of Yasukuni Shrine\".\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial Site\nNews about her election intentions\nInterview by Deborah Cameron"}
