The next day in retaliation Japanese soldiers and police in tracking the rebels as they fled back through the villages, assumed all who were in the vicinity either to be members of the militia or their confederates and punished them, by burning homes and summarily executing, bayoneting and machine-gunning village residents. Chinese sources place the number of victims at 3,217. Japanese sources place the number of victims at 800. The village was burned down and destroyed.\nIn 1972, remains of about 800 dead  compatriots were found in a mass grave 80 by 5 metres in size. A memorial hall was constructed to house these remains. It is situated in Xinbin Manchu Autonomous County in the prefecture of Fushun, China.\nA group of Chinese survivors of the massacre demanded 20 million yen from the Japanese government in reparations. In 2006, the Japanese Supreme Court ruled that a national court could not grant wartime indemnities, as this was a matter for international treaties.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\u5e73\u9802\u5c71\u6158\u6848\u7d00\u5ff5\u9928 (Pingdingshan Massacre Memorial Hall)"}
