This included staging false attacks on themselves using innocent people or concentration camp prisoners. Operation Himmler was arguably the first act of the Second World War in Europe.\n\nPlanning\nPrior to the 1939 invasion, German newspapers and politicians like Adolf Hitler carried out a national and international propaganda campaign accusing Polish authorities of organizing or tolerating violent ethnic cleansing of ethnic Germans living in Poland.The plan, named after its originator, Heinrich Himmler, was supervised by Reinhard Heydrich and managed by Heinrich M\u00fcller. The goal of this false flag project was to create the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany, which could be used to justify the German invasion of Poland. Hitler also might have hoped to confuse Poland's allies, the United Kingdom and France, into delaying or stopping their declaration of war on Germany.\n\nImplementation\nThe operations were mostly carried out on 31 August. The operation - as well as the main German offensive - was originally scheduled for 26 August; the shifting diplomatic situation resulted in delay until 31 August/1 September - but one of the German undercover units was not informed and carried out its attack on a German customs post; several Germans were killed before the incident ended. The operations were carried by agents of the SS and the SD. The German troops, dressed in Polish uniforms, would storm various border buildings, scare the locals with inaccurate shots, carry out acts of vandalism, and retreat, leaving behind dead bodies in Polish uniforms.\nThe bodies were in fact prisoners from concentration camps; they were dressed in Polish uniforms, killed (by a lethal injection, then shot for appearance) and left behind. They were described in plans as \"Konserve\", i.e. 'canned goods' (which also led to the more informal name of the operation, Operation Konserve).There were several separate operations, including staged attacks on:\n\nThe strategic railway at Jablunka Pass (Jab\u0142onk\u00f3w Incident), located on the border between Poland and Czechoslovakia\nThe German radio station Sender Gleiwitz (Gliwice) (this was arguably the most notable of Operation Himmler operations; see Gleiwitz incident)\nThe German customs station at Hochlinden (today part of Rybnik-Stodo\u0142y)\nThe forest service station in Pitschen (Byczyna)\nThe communications station at Neubersteich (\"Nieborowitzer Hammer\" before 12 February 1936, now Kuznia Nieborowska)\nThe railroad station in Alt-Eiche (Smolniki), Rosenberg in Westpreu\u00dfen district\nA woman and her companion in Katowice\n\nThe Gleiwitz incident\nOn the night of 31 August a small group of German operatives, dressed in Polish uniforms and led by Alfred Naujocks, seized the Gleiwitz station and broadcast a short anti-German message in Polish (sources vary on the content of the message). Several prisoners (most likely from the Dachau concentration camp) and a local Polish-Silesian activist (arrested a day before) were left dead on the scene in Polish uniforms.\n\nAftermath\nOn 1 September, in a speech in the Reichstag, Hitler cited the 21 border incidents as justification for Germany's \"defensive\" action against Poland:\n\nI can no longer find any willingness on the part of the Polish Government to conduct serious negotiations with us. These proposals for mediation have failed because in the meanwhile there, first of all, came as an answer the sudden Polish general mobilization, followed by more Polish atrocities. These were again repeated last night. Recently in one night there were as many as twenty-one frontier incidents: last night there were fourteen, of which three were quite serious. I have, therefore, resolved to speak to Poland in the same language that Poland for months past has used toward us...\nThis night for the first time Polish regular soldiers fired on our own territory. Since 5:45 a. m. we have been returning the fire... I will continue this struggle, no matter against whom, until the safety of the Reich and its rights are secured\nBy mid-1939, thousands of Polish Volksdeutsche had been secretly prepared for sabotage and guerrilla warfare by the Breslau (Wroc\u0142aw) office of the Abwehr; the purpose of their activities was to provoke anti-German reprisals that could be claimed as provocations by the Germans. Those German agents indeed cooperated with the German forces during the invasion of Poland, leading to some reprisals, which were highly exaggerated by the German Nazi propaganda. One of the most notable cases of such a scenario was reportedly carried out during Bydgoszcz Bloody Sunday. An instruction issued by the Ministry of Propaganda for the press said:\n\nmust show news on the barbarism of Poles in Bromberg. The expression \"bloody sunday\" must enter as a permanent term in the dictionary and circumnavigate the globe. For that reason, this term must be continuously underlined.\nThe operation failed to convince international public opinion of the German claims.\n\nSee also\nFalse flag\nOperation Tannenberg\nShelling of Mainila\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\n(in Polish) Tomasz Chinci\u0144ski, Niemiecka dywersja we wrze\u015bniu 1939 w Londy\u0144skich meldunkach, Biuletyn Instytutu Pami\u0119ci Narodowej, nr 8-9/2004\n(in Polish) Tomasz Chinci\u0144ski, Niemiecka dywersja w Polsce w 1939 r. w \u015bwietle dokument\u00f3w policyjnych i wojskowych II Rzeczypospolitej oraz s\u0142u\u017cb specjalnych III Rzeszy.
