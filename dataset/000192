The German military High Command finalized its operational orders on 15 June 1939 and the invasion commenced on 1 September, precipitating World War II.\n\nBackground\nThe origins of the plan went back to 1928, when Werner von Fritsch started working on it. Fall Weiss was developed primarily by G\u00fcnther Blumentritt and Erich von Manstein while the two were serving as staff officers under General Gerd von Rundstedt with Army Group South in Silesia.\n\nDetails\nThe plan called for a start of hostilities before the declaration of war. German units were to invade Poland from three directions:\n\nA primary attack from the German mainland across the western border of Poland.\nA secondary attack from the north, from the exclave of East Prussia.\nA tertiary attack by German and allied Slovak units across the border of Slovakia.All three assaults were to converge on Warsaw while the main Polish army was to be encircled and destroyed west of the Vistula River.\nThe plan was initiated on 1 September 1939 and was the first European military operation of World War II.\n\nSee also\n\nPlan Zach\u00f3d for the Polish defence plan\nGerman order of battle for Operation Fall Weiss\nList of Axis operational codenames in the European TheatreOther German plans named for colors:\n\nFall Rot (\"Case Red\") (1935) \u2013 planned defense against an incursion by France following a German invasion of Czechoslovakia.\nFall Gr\u00fcn (Czechoslovakia) (\"Case Green\") (1938) \u2013 planned invasion of Czechoslovakia.\nFall Gelb (\"Case Yellow\") (1940) \u2013 also known as the \"Manstein Plan\", the offensive against Western Europe.\nFall Gr\u00fcn (Ireland) (\"Case Green\") (1940) \u2013 planned invasion of Ireland.\nFall Blau (\"Case Blue\") (1942) \u2013 summer offensive on the Eastern Front in southern Russia.\nFall Weiss (\"Case White\") (1943) \u2013 joint Axis operation against Partisans throughout occupied Yugoslavia.\n\n\n== References =="}
