The commanding officer of the 14th Regiment, Col. Edward Godlewski ordered a cavalry charge. German infantry was taken by surprise, but machine guns and tanks hidden nearby opened fire on the cavalry. Eventually Polish units broke through towards Warsaw, as intended, but at the cost of heavy losses (105 killed, 100 wounded - about 20% of their initial strength).\nThe battle was witnessed and described by the Italian war correspondent Mario Appelius.\n\nReferences\nSources\nKrzysztof Komorowski, Boje Polski 1939, Przewodnik encyklopedyczny.\nHerz, Lechos\u0142aw (1990).
