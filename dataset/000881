On May 21, 1932, the Manchuria Sports Association formally applied to the Organizing Committee of the Olympics to dispatch players to the Los Angeles Olympics (held in July 1932). The Organizing Committee urges the Manchuria country to apply to the International Olympic Committee as \u201cparticipation is approved by the International Olympic Committee (IOC)\u201d and informs the Organizing Committee to send the national flag and national anthem, they have done it. On the other hand, there is still a record that the Manchuria Sports Association sent a document stating that \u201cthe national flag and national anthem were sent to the organizing committee\u201d to the secretary general of the Olympic organizing committee. Before May, the song was completed.\n\n1933 version\nThe first national anthem was declared by State Council Decree No.4, dated 24 February D\u00e0t\u00f3ng 2 (1933) but publicized on March 1. The lyrics were written by Manchukuo's first Prime Minister Zheng Xiaoxu, who was a devout Confucianist and Qing loyalist in addition to being an accomplished poet and calligrapher.\n\n1942 version\nThe national anthem was changed on 5 September K\u0101ngd\u00e9 9 (1942), by State Council Order No. 201. Prime Minister of Manchukuo Zhang Jinghui cited the 1933 version of the anthem was unsuitable for the current situations of the Empire as the reason for the change. The new anthem, with Manchurian (i.e. Mandarin Chinese) and Japanese lyrics, was written by a committee, according to Zhang. The 1933 anthem was renamed the Manchukuo Independence Song (\u6eff\u6d32\u570b\u5efa\u570b\u6b4c, pinyin: M\u01cenzh\u014dugu\u00f3 ji\u00e0n gu\u00f3g\u0113, Japanese Hepburn romanization: Manshukoku-kenkoku uta).\n\nLyrics\nOfficial Interpretation\nAccording to the official interpretation of the anthem issued on the same day of its adoption, the \"God\" in the first line refers to Amaterasu, the sun goddess in Shinto, referring to Manchukuo's adoption of State Shinto as its state religion in 1940. Also, God's Light is interpreted as Arahitogami, i.e. Emperor of Japan. The whole of the first line is interpreted as \n\nwith this Divine Light, the Universe is created, and the bright and peaceful (it used the kanji \u662d\u548c, cognate of Sh\u014dwa, for bright and peaceful.) Light fills and shines over our Manchurian land and rivers, and with that we have our independence and our successes after independence. His Majesty the Emperor (i.e. Kangde) received this Divine Light to rule our country and to love our citizens. The first line [...] is an ode to our state.\n\"The Divine Work\" in the fourth line came from Kangde's Imperial Rescript on the Tenth Anniversary of the Nation on 1 March 1942, in which he mentioned, We should sharpen our mind and spirits to sacrifice to the holy Greater East Asia War and help in the Divine Work of our Parent Nation...\nand hence interpreted as: \n\nThis line describes the determination of our citizens. The Imperial Message on March 1 stated \"[to] help in the Divine Work of the Parent Nation,\" and the Divine Work of Japan, our Parent Nation, is to revitalize East Asia and to create the Co-prosperity Sphere[...] Our country is the pioneer in the prosperity of East Asia[...] Our citizens should revere this Divine Work of our Parent Nation and to help it in all our endeavors, to finalize the goal of our independence, to rebuild the world, and that the Divine Work maybe as large and permanent as the sun and the moon.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nNational anthem of Manchukuo with music and lyrics"}
