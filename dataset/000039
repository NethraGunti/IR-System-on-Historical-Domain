Phraya Songsuradet (Thai: \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e32\u0e17\u0e23\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e40\u0e14\u0e0a) did not instigate the rebellion or coup, yet it was named after him. The coup was carried out by Plaek Phibunsongkhram (Thai: \u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e39\u0e25\u0e2a\u0e07\u0e04\u0e23\u0e32\u0e21) or \"Phibun\" on 29 January 1939 to purge the country of his political enemies and former rivals, one of whom happened to be Songsuradet.\n\nBackground\nBorn in 1892 as Thep Panthumasen (Thai: \u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e \u0e1e\u0e31\u0e19\u0e18\u0e38\u0e21\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19), Songsuradet was commissioned in the Royal Thai Army as an artillery lieutenant after graduating from the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy and furthering his studies in Germany where he studied at the engineer school. He returned to Thailand in 1915. From then on he was given many responsibilities, especially the construction of railways. In 1932 he was given the title Phraya Songsuradet by King Prajadhipok (Rama VII). He played a crucial role in the Revolution of 1932 and subsequently became an important member of the new Thai constitutional government.\nThe roots of the rebellion began during the coup d'\u00e9tat of June 1933, when Phraya Phahon Phonphayuhasena ousted Phraya Manopakorn Nititada and replaced him as prime minister. As with many other supporters of Phraya Mano, Songsuradet was permanently barred from politics by the new premier. He spent the next two years exiled in Sri Lanka. \nDuring, before, and after the coup, conflicts arose between Songsuradet and Phibun, who were both ministers of state and members of the People's Committee.\nWhen Phibun succeeded Phraya Phahon as Prime Minister of Thailand on 11 September 1938, there was much resistance to his premiership due to his dictatorial style and cronyism. This, coupled with his role in suppressing the Boworadet Rebellion, resulted in three assassination attempts, two by gunmen and one by poisoning.\n\nThe purge\nIn 1938, Songsuradet, by then having retired from politics for five years (but not yet from the army) was commander of the military school in Chiang Mai. On 16 December he was commanding a military exercise by his students in Ratchaburi Province, west of the capital. On that date he received orders from Bangkok stripping him of his command of all units as well as his rank and titles and forcing him to retire from the army without pension. He was also expelled from the country. Fearing death, Songsuradet complied, and with his aide-de-camp, Captain Samruad Kanjonsit (Thai: \u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e23\u0e27\u0e08 \u0e01\u0e32\u0e0d\u0e08\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e17\u0e18\u0e34\u0e4c), he escaped to Cambodia.\nThe \"rebellion\", however, did not end there. In the early hours of 29 January 1939 Phibun, with the help of his minister of the interior and director of the Royal Thai Police, ordered the arrest of a further 51 suspects (suspected of being Songsuradet sympathizers). The persons arrested included inter alia Prince Rangsit, Prince of Chainat (Thai: \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e04\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e23\u0e31\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e15\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e39\u0e23\u0e28\u0e31\u0e01\u0e14\u0e34\u0e4c) (a son of King Chulalongkorn), General Phraya Thepahatsadin (Thai: \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e32\u0e40\u0e17\u0e1e\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e34\u0e19) (a 62-year-old former commander of the Siamese Expeditionary Force during the First World War), and Phraya Udom Pongphensawad (Thai: \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e22\u0e32\u0e2d\u0e38\u0e14\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e07\u0e28\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e1e\u0e47\u0e0d\u0e2a\u0e27\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e14\u0e34\u0e4c), a former minister of state. Others arrested included politicians such as members of the People's Assembly and many were military officers and aristocrats. A further 20 suspects were arrested by the end of the day, including one of Phibun's servants. \nA special tribunal was created by Phibun to try those purportedly involved in the so-called \"rebellion\" and the assassination attempts on Phibun . Seven were released for lack of evidence, 25 were imprisoned for life, and 21 were to be executed by firing squad. However, three were pardoned due to their honorable records and services to the nation. The three included Prince Rangsit and Phraya Thepahatsadin, who were instead imprisoned for life. The other 18, however did not share that fate. They were incarcerated at Bang Kwang Central Prison. Eventually they were executed by firing squad in installments of four prisoners a day.\n\nAftermath\nSongsuradet, having escaped to Cambodia, lived the rest of his life in abject poverty, making a living by selling confectionery in the streets of Phnom Penh. He died in 1944. Many of the other suspects who were imprisoned by Phibun were eventually pardoned by Khuang Abhaiwongse when he became prime minister in 1944.\nThe rebellion was in effect Phibun's own version of the Night of the Long Knives. By 1938 he had consolidated his power to such an extent that he had become virtual dictator of the country, changing its name from \"Siam\" to \"Thailand\" in June 1938. He was able to accomplish this using brutal tactics and the absence of any credible opposition. Prajadhipok had by then been succeeded to the throne by Ananda Mahidol, who was only 13 years old and studying in Switzerland. The tribunal which Phibun had set up to try the suspects was packed with judges appointed by him and his government. There were no lawyers present and no witnesses were called. Historians agree today that the men executed were mostly innocent and were not a part of a plot to kill Phibun or overthrow his government. Phibun was eventually removed in 1944. Four years later he returned and served as prime minister from 1948\u20131957. He died in 1964.\n\nSee also\nSiamese Revolution of 1932\nSiamese coup d'\u00e9tat of 1933\nBoworadet Rebellion\n\nReferences\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20070927023446/http://www.rakbankerd.com/01_jam/thaiinfor/country_info/index.html?topic_id=45&filename=revolutionary5.htm\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20091027100534/http://geocities.com/drsak/youngturk/youngturk011.txt\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20070927024443/http://www.rakbankerd.com/01_jam/thaiinfor/country_info/index.html?topic_id=59&db_file"}
