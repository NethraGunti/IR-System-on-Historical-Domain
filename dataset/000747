Along with Tales of Hulan River, it is generally regarded as one of Xiao Hong's most successful works.Set in a village near the city of Harbin, the novel examines the difficulties of peasant life during the 1920s and early 1930s, and in particular the suffering of women. The latter part of the novel also deals with life under occupation after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.\n\nPlot\nThe novel has no main protagonist or plotline, being comprised instead of loosely connected scenes of village life.\nThe novel begins by introducing Two-and-a-half Li \u4e8c\u91cc\u534a and his wife, Old Mother Pockface \u9ebb\u9762\u5a46, and son, Tunnel Legs \u7f57\u5708\u817f.\nA seventeen-year-old girl from the village, Golden Bough \u91d1\u679d, has been secretly having sex with twenty-year-old Ch'eng-yeh \u6210\u4e1a.

She becomes even more angry when Golden Bough tells her that she is pregnant.\nAnother villager, Chao San \u8d75\u4e09, has crippled a thief whom he mistook as a man from his landlord who threatened to damage his firewood in place of unpaid rent. In consequence, Chao San is jailed and forced to sell his ox to pay compensation. His son P'ing \u5e73\u513f works as a shepherd and also later helps his newly freed father sell chicken cages in the city. The chicken cage business, however, quickly fails.\nSecond Sister Li \u674e\u4e8c\u5a76 suffers a miscarriage after a long and painful labor. Her husband is unsympathetic. Old Mother Pockface and Golden Bough both, however, give birth successfully.\nAfter her son is killed by bandits, Mother Wang \u738b\u5a46 tries to commit suicide by poison.

In his anger, he kills the child.\nTen years pass. The Japanese have invaded, and soldiers search the town for rebels and take away young women.

Golden Bough, now widowed, goes into the city to look for work. She makes money repairing clothing, but is also expected to prostitute herself to her male customers. She returns to the village.\nBy the end of the novel, Old Mother Pockface has been killed by the Japanese, as has her son Tunnel Legs.
