It started on 1 September and ended with a German victory on 4 September. German historiography has dealt with the fighting in the larger context of the Battle of Tuchola Forest.\nThe Polish border city of Grudzi\u0105dz (Germ. Graudenz) contained headquarters of the 16th Infantry Division, as well as the military Center of Cavalry Training (Centrum Wyszkolenia Kawalerii). Moreover, it played a crucial role as a strongpoint in order to defend the Vistula River Line and secure the route of retreat of Polish divisions of the Pomorze Army under General W\u0142adys\u0142aw Bortnowski, engaged on the left, western bank of the river. Among units stationed in the Polish Corridor were the 9th, the 15th, and the 27th I.D.'s, together with the Pomeranian Cavalry Brigade from Bydgoszcz. Since Polish headquarters had planned an armed intervention in the Free City of Danzig, the 27th I.D. and the Pomeranian Cavalry had been transferred northwards in mid-August 1939, to the area of Chojnice and Starogard Gda\u0144ski. On 1 September 1939, at the moment of the invasion, both units remained in the Corridor, vulnerable to a German attack. East of the Vistula, along the line stretching from Grudzi\u0105dz to Lidzbark (Germ. Lautenburg) stood the German 4th Army, under General G\u00fcnther von Kluge. Grudzi\u0105dz itself was defended by the Operational Group East (Grupa Operacyjna Wsch\u00f3d), under Gen. Miko\u0142aj Bo\u0142tu\u0107. The group consisted of the 4th from Toru\u0144 (Colonel Tadeusz Lubicz-Niezabitowski), and the local 16th Infantry Division (Colonel Stanis\u0142aw \u015awitalski), both part of the Pomorze Army.\n\n1 September 1939\nThe area of Grudzi\u0105dz was assaulted by the German XXI Corps (Gen. von Falkenhorst) on 1 September, when the German 21st and 218th Infantry Divisions pushed back the Polish lines behind the small river Osa, east of Grudzi\u0105dz. The main German attack was concentrated on the left Polish wing, defended by the 16th I.D. In the area of \u0141asin, German units were halted, but another attack, near D\u0105br\u00f3wka Kr\u00f3lewska, was successful. After crossing the Osa, the Germans captured a bridgehead near Bielawki. On 1 September, in the afternoon, after receiving reinforcements, the Germans continued their attack, which was finally halted by the Poles at app. 7 p.m. During the night of 1-2 September, General Bo\u0142tu\u0107 led the 4th Infantry Division in a counterattack the German 218th Infantry Division, in order to push the invaders back behind the Osa. Although Polish forces gained some ground, the attack was finally repulsed.\n\n2 September 1939\nOn 2 September, at 8 a.m., the Germans began an assault, aiming to push further back the 16th I.D. After an artillery barrage, German infantry moved into the action, managing to expand the bridgehead. The situation of Polish troops was particularly difficult in the western wing of their line of defence, and as a result, the 66th and the 64th infantry regiments (part of the 16th I.D.) had to retreat towards the Grudzi\u0105dz - Jab\u0142onowo Pomorskie railroad. To save the situation, General Bortnowski ordered 142nd squadron of the Polish Air Force (Colonel Boles\u0142aw Stacho\u0144) to bomb German positions. The bombing did not bring any significant gains for the Poles, and in the afternoon of that day, the Poles began to retreat. Panic broke out in some Polish units, as the Wehrmacht, supported by the local Fifth Column, attacked the 208th reserve infantry regiment.\nNevertheless, General Bo\u0142tu\u0107 ordered Colonel Lubicz-Niezabitowski's 4th I.D. to counterattack, in order to help the 16th I.D., which was under heavy German pressure. The 4th I.D. attacked from Radzy\u0144 Che\u0142mi\u0144ski towards Me\u0142no, and the assault began at 8 p.m. Initially, the Germans retreated towards Annowo and Gruta, which was recaptured by the Poles at midnight. Furthermore, Polish 65th infantry regiment recaptured Nicwa\u0142d, but the Poles were halted before they reached their original defensive positions along the Osa. On that night General Bo\u0142tu\u0107 dismissed Colonel Stanis\u0142aw \u015awitalski, who was unable to control his men, and replaced him with Colonel Zygmunt Bohusz-Szyszko.\n\n3 and 4 September 1939\nSunday 3 September 1939 began with a massive German assault on Polish positions. At the same time Bo\u0142tu\u0107 received news that the Polish divisions on the western bank of the Vistula were facing defeat and the German forces had already crossed the Vistula in the south. This forced him to pull back his units in order to avoid being soon encircled. The Polish defenders destroyed the bridges over the Vistula and retreated to the south-east, towards the Drw\u0119ca river, where they took new defensive positions. Grudzi\u0105dz itself was abandoned on Sunday in the early afternoon. After a few hours, elements of the German 45th Infantry Regiment entered the city, but main German forces did not capture all of Grudzi\u0105dz until the morning of Monday 4 September.\n\nSee also\nSiege of Graudenz\n\nLiterature\nEugeniusz Koz\u0142owski (Ed.): Wojna obronna Polski 1939, Wydawnictwo Ministerstwa Obrony Nradowej, Warszawa 1979.
