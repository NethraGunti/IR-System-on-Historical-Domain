It was bordered on the southeast by the Yalu River, which separated it from Korea.\n\nHistory\nThe name of the province Antung in Chinese means \"pacify the east\" and was likely inspired by the Protectorate General to Pacify the East established during the Tang Dynasty.\nAntung Province was first created in 1934 as an anto (province) of the Japanese-controlled Empire of Manchukuo, when the former Fengtian Province was divided into three parts: Antung Province, Fengtian Province and Jinzhou Province. Antung was further sub-divided in 1939 into Antung Province and Tonghua Province.\nAfter the annexation of Manchukuo by the Republic of China after the end of World War II, the Kuomintang reunited Antung and Tonghua, and continued to recognize the area as Antung Province. However, under the administration of the People's Republic of China, Antung Province was renamed as Liaodong Province and it was abolished in 1954, and its area was divided between Liaoning Province and Jilin Province.\n\nAdministration division\nThe capital of Antung Province from 1934\u20131939 was Tonghua, in modern-day Jilin. However, after the 1939 administrative reorganization of the province, the capital moved to Antung, an important border town between Manchukuo and Korea, and a major center on the railroad from Korea to Mukden.\nThe area of the province (from 1934\u20131939 and 1945\u20131954) was 62,160 km2 (24,000 sq mi).\n\n1949\u20131954\nSee also\nList of administrative divisions of Manchukuo\nMap showing the location of Andong within the claimed territories of the ROC\n\nExternal links\nmap of the Andong Province of Manchukuo"}
