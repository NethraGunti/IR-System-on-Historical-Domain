He served as deputy head of Yeke-juu League (today Ordos City). An ethnic Mongol, he was a native of Right-Wing Rear Banner, Ordos (today administered as Hanggin Banner, Ordos City).\n\nNames\nHis Mongolian name may be spelled two different ways, with a variety of transcriptions of his Mongolian name into Chinese characters:\n\nAltanochir or Altan Ochir (Chinese: \u963f\u62c9\u5766\u9102\u9f4a\u723e; pinyin: \u0100l\u0101t\u01cen\u00e8q\u00ed\u011br), his Mongolian name\nAltanvachir or Altan Vachir (Chinese: \u963f\u52d2\u5510\u74e6\u9f4a\u723e or \u963f\u52d2\u5510\u74e6\u5176\u723e; pinyin: \u0100l\u0113t\u00e1ngw\u01ceq\u00ed\u011br), an earlier transcription of his Mongolian nameFor short, he was sometimes referred to as Prince A or A Wang (from Chinese \u963f\u738b).\n\nCareer\nAltanochir was appointed as the deputy head of Yeke-juu League in 1919. He was also a soldier in the Republic of China's National Revolutionary Army; in 1928 he became deputy commander (\u526f\u53f8\u4ee4) for the Baotou region. In March 1934, he was appointed a member of the Nanjing government's newly established Mongolian Local Autonomous Political Committee. He sided with Prince Pandegunchab of D\u00f6rbed Banner, Ulanqab League in opposing the Mongol autonomy movement. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant general in 1937.However, he would join the pro-Japanese Mongol United Autonomous Government after its establishment in 1937. He took up the position of deputy head of Yeke-juu league under that government as well in February 1938. Previously a close friend of local warlord Fu Zuoyi, he asked Prince Demchugdongrub to send troops to help him break out of the control of Fu Zuoyi and join Demchugdongrub's autonomy movement. Overlooking Altanochir's former friendship with the warlord and his questionable loyalty to the Mongol autonomy movement, Demchugdongrub agreed to send one cavalry brigade in the spring of 1938 to assist him. After the formation of the Mengjiang United Autonomous Government in October 1939, Altanochir became a member of the Mongol Revival Committee (\u8208\u8499\u59d4\u54e1\u6703) and general commander of the Ordos Army (\u9102\u723e\u591a\u65af\u633a\u9032\u8ecd). In 1947 after the war had ended, he returned to his position as deputy head of Yeke-juu league. In early 1949 he was named a member of the Mongol Autonomous Preparatory Committee (\u8499\u53e4\u81ea\u6cbb\u7c4c\u5099\u59d4\u54e1\u6703) at Dingyuanying (\u5b9a\u9060\u71df; today Bayan Hot, Alxa League); he died there on 16 April 1949.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\n\u5b9d\u529b\u683c \u2014 Bolig (July 2004), \"\u5185\u8499\u53e4\u5386\u53f2\u4e0a\u7684\u5fb7\u7a46\u695a\u514b\u680b\u9c81\u666e \u2014  Demchugdongrub in Inner Mongolian History\", \u9ed1\u9f99\u6c5f\u7701\u8499\u53e4\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4f1a\u901a\u8baf \u2014  Communications of the Heilongjiang Association for Mongolian Studies (20), archived from the original on 2011-08-14, retrieved 2011-08-04CS1 maint: multiple names: authors list (link)\nGuan, Guangyao; Wu, Jianhui (1999), Historical treasures of China: a collection of rare manuscripts from the archives of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Inner Mongolia Archives Department, ISBN 978-962-683-049-9\nJagchid, Senchin (1999), The Last Mongol Prince: The Life and Times of Demchugdongrob, 1902-1966, Center for East Asian Studies, Western Washington University, ISBN 978-091-458-421-6\nHyer, Paul; Jagchid, Sechin (1983), A Mongolian living Buddha: biography of the Kanjurwa Khutughtu, SUNY Press, ISBN 978-0-87395-713-7\n\u5f90\u53cb\u6625 \u2014 Xu Youchun, ed.
