It was established by Imperial Decree No. 1 on March 1, 1934 and published by law of April 19, 1934. The order consisted of only two classes: Grand Collar and Grand Cordon. The order the equivalent of the Japanese Order of the Chrysanthemum.\n\nDesign\nThe design was chosen to be an orchid because it was reportedly Puyi's favorite flower.The collar consists of one central large link and 20 small links, interconnected by figured intermediate links in the form of a Buddhist \"endless knot\". Small chain links are openwork slotted pentagons with rounded corners, symbolizing clouds. Eight of them are inscribed covered with green enamel \"eight auspicious signs of Buddha\": to the left of the central link - a lotus flower, a precious vessel, two fish and an endless knot; to the right of the central link - the shell, the wheel of learning, the precious umbrella and the banner of victory. The central link is an openwork slotted hexagon, symbolizing a cloud, into which a round medallion of blue enamel is inscribed. The medallion depicts a dragon \"in the clouds\" wriggling around the flaming Sun.\nThe cordon is gold, with a diameter of 71 mm, it is a stylized image of the main imperial symbol - an orchid flower. On the obverse, the badge looks like a round jagged medallion of green enamel, on which a star of five narrow \u201cpetals\u201d of yellow enamel is superimposed. A large pearl is fixed in the center of the star, between the \"petals\" there are golden stalks with fixed small pearls, five in each corner. On the reverse side of the badge there are four characters: \"\u5927\u52f2\u4f4d\u7ae0\" (\"the highest award for merit\"). Through a rectangular bracket on the upper \"petal\" the sign is attached to an intermediate link, which is a reduced copy of the sign itself, without enamels and pearls. At the upper end of the intermediate link there is a transverse eyelet for attaching to the order chain.\nThe order was the highest award of the empire. The Order of the Orchid Blossom was divided into two classes: the collar (\u5927\u52f2\u4f4d\u862d\u82b1\u7ae0\u9838\u98fe) and the cordon (\u5927\u52f2\u4f4d\u862d\u82b1\u5927\u7dac\u7ae0). The collar was intended for monarchs and heads of state on a large ribbon.\n\nRecipients\nIt was awarded at least 2 times and was discontinued in 1945 after the Soviet invasion of Manchuria.\n\n Hirohito\n PuyiThe order may have been awarded to other kings such as King Michael I of Romania but there is not enough information to prove or disprove this claim.\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nIonina, N.
