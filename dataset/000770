A romance sparks, but is soon interrupted by a fierce group of murderous bandits. Fleeing, Emmy and Hank team up with others, eventually culminating in a fierce shootout with the marauders.  A youngster of ten years, the Emmy and Hank team seek safety in a small fort or an antiquated country home located on barren lands.  As the bandits approach, they hide in a basement level, protected only by a floorboard cover.  As the bandits enter the building, the baby of Emmy and Hank begins to cry, thereby revealing the location of the couple and their team.  As the bandits begin to chop their way through the floorboards, a rescue squad on motorcycles speeds over a nearby hill towards the building, then succeeding to rescue those trapped below the floor.\n\nBehind the scenes\n20th Century Fox considered the film mediocre and it was shelved. A year later, with actress Alice Faye's popularity booming, the film was released to expected sub-par success.\nThere were extensive revisions and retakes which eliminated actors J. Edward Bromberg and Joseph Schildkraut from the cast. The song \"There'll Be Other Nights\" by Lew Brown and Lew Pollack, recorded by Alice Faye, was cut from the final print.\n\nCast\nAlice Faye as Emmy Jordan\nWarner Baxter  as Hank Topping\nCharles Winninger  as Samuel J.
