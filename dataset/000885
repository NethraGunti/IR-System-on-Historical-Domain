It was founded in 1934 in Harbin, and was made up of Russian nationals aged between 10 and 16.\nThe objectives of the Union were:\n\nthe preservation of the national identity of Russian children;\nthe systematic education of Russian national spirit;\nstrict observance of the Russian Orthodox faith and the old traditions of Russia;\nto act as a feeder group for membership of the senior Russian Fascist Party.The uniform of the Vanguard was a black shirt with yellow buttons and blue epaulettes, a sword belt, and black trousers issued by the Union. Headgear was a black peaked cap with orange piping and a laurelate letter \"A\" emblem.\n\nIn common with the girls section\nThe ideology and tactics of the Union were entirely determined by members of the Russian Fascist Party. Membership was obtained on recommendation of an existing member of the Vanguard, or a member of the senior Russian Fascist Party.\nThe Union was divided into two groups: Junior (10 to 13 years) and Senior (13 to 16 years). Each group was divided into two categories: Second Level (Young Fascist) and First Level (Avangardisty).\nCommanding officers in the Union were the Senior Source, the Senior District Commander and Senior Divisional Commander.\nThe lowest structural unit in the Union was the \"Focus\", a group of five people. Several of these that were geographically close to each other formed a District, and together with other suburban areas or otherwise related groups, they formed a Department. The head of the group was appointed by the head of the Russian Fascist Party.\nAt the head of the Union Vanguard was Chief of the Vanguard, appointed by the head of the Russian Fascist Party. The other leaders were appointed on the orders of the Chief of the Vanguard.\n\nReferences\nStephan, John J. The Russian Fascists: Tragedy and Farce in Exile, 1925-1945.
