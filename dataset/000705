The AVG was operational from December 20, 1941, to July 14, 1942. The press continued to apply the Flying Tigers name to later units, but pilots of those organizations are not included.\nIn most air forces, a victory is defined as the destruction of an enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat, and those shown below are the \"confirmed\" claims as recorded in AVG records, unearthed by aviation historian Frank Olynyk.
