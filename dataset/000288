Formed twice, it participated in several battles, most notably the Soviet westward offensive of 1918\u20131919 and the Estonian War of Independence. The division's first formation was awarded the Order of the Red Banner twice and the Order of Suvorov 2nd class for its valor in combat. In November 1945, the division was disbanded. It was briefly reformed in 1955 but disbanded again in 1957.\n\nFirst formation\nThe Division was first formed on May 3, 1918, in the city of Gdov. It was made up of volunteers from Petrograd, soldiers of Pavel Dybenko's volunteer detachment, Red Guards from the regular Army, and workers from the city of Narva. Its official designation upon activation was the Gatchina Infantry Division. From May to November 1918, the division was deployed in the vicinity of Ivangorod. On July 24, 1918 it became the 3rd Petrograd Infantry Division. On November 2, 1918, it became the 6th Rifle Division.The Division defended Petrograd alongside the Red Army. In May 1919, the first assault by White Army units commanded by Nikolay Yudenich were defeated by the division. The division then became part of the Consolidated Baltic Division. On 5 August, the division retreated from the Yamburg area in order to concentrate on the defense of Petrograd. In autumn 1919, the rifle division defeated the Estonian 1st Division's Krasnaya Gorka Offensive. In October 1919, the division went on the offensive and captured Krasnoye Selo.In November 1919 the Division attacked Narva with the Red Army, starting the Estonian War of Independence. This was part of the Soviet westward offensive, a campaign to conquer the Baltic states and Belarus. The unit was redesignated twice during this campaign. \nThe 6th Rifle Division then saw action in the campaign to conquer the city of Narva. This was a homecoming of sorts for the Division, as many of its soldiers were workers from the city. The operation lasted from November through December 1919. The Estonian 1st Division and the White Russian Northwestern Division were pushed beyond the Soviet-Estonian border. The Division protected the border from January to May 1920.\nIn May and June the Division was called to participate in an offensive against Poland. By July and August the fighting was intensifying in the Dokshitsy region. By September the offensive was deep into Poland around the Warsaw region.

The division pushed back the Polish-led 1st Lithuanian-Belarusian Infantry Division in the vicinity of Mosty. Although ultimately stopped by the Polish 81st Grodno Rifles Infantry Regiment, the division forced the Polish troops to retreat and abandon their lines.Following the Polish summer retreat towards the Vistula, the division pursued the Polish forces. On August 9 it captured Wyszk\u00f3w and then advanced north of Bug, Narew and Vistula towards \u0141om\u017ca. The town fell to the Soviets, but a successful counter-attack on \u0141om\u017ca carried out by Polish 59th Greater Polish Infantry Regiment recaptured the town. The Soviet division lost many of their prisoners of war. Following the Battle of Warsaw, the 6th Rifle Division was defeated. Recreated as part of the Soviet defenses along the Niemen river, it took part in the Second Battle of the Niemen River. Defeated east of Wilejka by Polish cavalry, it was surrounded and completely eliminated. The Poles captured its headquarters, tabor, 13 field kitchens and the remaining two pieces of artillery, as well as all commanding officers of the division's regiments.The unit was later re-created behind the front. On December 6, 1921, it received the honorific \"Orel\". The division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its actions. In 1939 the Division became a training unit and split into separate cadres.
