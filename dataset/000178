He graduated in chemistry at the American University in Cairo and organized the Congress of Educated Muslims.\nInitially, he took a post in the settlement department of the British Mandate government but eventually moved to the Hebron area during the 1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine to lead the struggle against the British. A member of the Palestine Arab Party, he served as its secretary-general and became editor-in-chief of the party's paper Al-Liwa\u2019 and other newspapers, including Al-Jami\u2019a Al-Islamiyya.\nAbd al-Qadir married in 1934 and fathered Faisal al-Husayni (17 July 1940 \u2013 31 May 2001), the founder and leader of Arab Studies Society, head of Fatah organization in the West Bank and Palestinian Authority Minister for Jerusalem Affairs.\n\nBattle of al-Qastal\nIn 1938, Husayni was exiled and in 1939 fled to Iraq where he took part in the Rashid Ali al-Gaylani coup. He moved to Egypt in 1946, but secretly returned to Palestine to lead the Army of the Holy War in January 1948. Husayni was killed while personally reconnoitring an area of Qastal Hill shrouded by fog, in the early hours of 8 April 1948. His forces later captured al-Qastal from the Haganah, which had occupied the village at the start of Operation Nachshon six days earlier with a force of about 100 men. They retreated to the Jewish settlement of Motza. Palmach troops recaptured the village on the night of 8\u20139 April, losing 18 men in the attack; most of the houses were blown up and the hill became a command post. Huseyni's death was a factor in the loss of morale among his forces.\n\nSee also\nBen Yehuda Street Bombing\n\nFootnotes\nReferences\nBenveni\u015bt\u00ee, M\u00ear\u00f4n (2002).
