'Harmony language') is either of two pidginized languages, one Japanese-based and one Chinese-based, that were spoken in Manchukuo in the 1930s and 1940s.  They are also known as K\u014da-go (\u8208\u4e9e\u8a9e, \"Asia development language\"), Nichiman-go (\u65e5\u6eff\u8a9e, \"Japanese-Manchu language\"), and Dait\u014da-go (\u5927\u6771\u4e9e\u8a9e, \"Greater East Asia language\").\n\nDescription\nThe term Kyowa-go/Xieheyu is derived from the Manchukuo state motto \"Concord of Nationalities\" (\u6c11\u65cf\u5354\u548c m\u00ednz\u00fa xi\u00e9he) promoted by the Pan-Asian Movement. The pidgin language resulted from the need of Japanese officials and soldiers and the Han and Manchu population that spoke mainly Chinese to communicate with each other. Manchukuo officials later dubbed the pidgin language \"Kyowa-go\" or \"Xieheyu\", meaning \"Concord language\". However, the Japanese also wanted to implement their own language in Manchukuo, saying that Japanese is a language which has a soul, so the language must be spoken correctly.\nKyowa-go/Xieheyu died out when Manchukuo fell to the Soviet Red Army in the last days of World War II. Documentation of the pidgin language is rare today.\nIt was also believed that many of the expressions of Chinese characters in manga (e.g. aru) are derived from Japanese-based Kyowa-go. Hence, it is typical of Chinese characters in anime shows to speak in that manner.\nIt was also believed that many of the expressions of Japanese characters in movies set in the Second Sino-Japanese War (e.g. \u6084\u6084\u5730\u9032\u6751\uff0c\u6253\u69cd\u7684\u4e0d\u8981) are derived from Chinese-based Xieheyu. Hence, it is typical of Japanese characters in movies shows to speak in that manner.\nThe Japanese were also known to use pidgin languages in Japan itself during the 19th and 20th centuries like Yokohama Pidgin Japanese.\n\nExamples of Japanese-based Kyowa-go\nKyowa-go is characterized by a particle aru, omission of some particles, and many loan-words from Chinese language.\u3000\n\n\u79c1\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u30a2\u30eb\u30e8 Watashi nipponjin aru yo\nOriginal Japanese: \u79c1\u306f\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u3067\u3059 Watashi wa nipponjin desu meaning \"I am a Japanese\".\n\u59d1 (\u30af\u30fc)\u5a18 (\u30cb\u30e3\u30f3)\u7dba\u9e97\u30a2\u30eb\u30cd K\u016bnyan (g\u016bnyan) kirei aru ne\nOriginal Japanese: \u304a\u5b43\u3055\u3093\u306f\u7dba\u9e97\u3067\u3059\u306d Oj\u014dsan wa kirei desu ne meaning \"Your daughter is beautiful\"\n\u8cb4\u65b9\u5ea7\u308b\u306e\u6905\u5b50\u306a\u3044\u30a2\u30eb\u30e8 Anata suwaru no isu nai aru yo\nOriginal Japanese: \u8cb4\u65b9\u304c\u5ea7\u308b\u6905\u5b50\u306f\u3042\u308a\u307e\u305b\u3093 \"Anata ga suwaru isu wa arimasen\" meaning \"There is no chair for you\"\n\u30a2\u30a4\u30e4\u30fc\uff08\u54ce\u5440\uff09 Aiyaa!\nExclamation of surprise from the Chinese.\n\nExamples of Chinese-based Xieheyu\nXieheyu sometimes uses subject\u2013object\u2013verb, the normal Japanese word order, which is different from Standard Chinese.\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u5e6b\u6211\uff0c\u6211\u7684\u9322\u7684\u5927\u5927\u7684\u7d66\u3002 n\u01d0de b\u0101ngw\u01d2, w\u01d2de qi\u00e1nde d\u00e0d\u00e0de g\u011bi.\nOriginal Chinese: \u4f60\u5e6b\u6211\uff0c\u6211\u7d66\u4f60\u5f88\u591a\u9322\u3002 n\u01d0 b\u0101ngw\u01d2, w\u01d2 g\u011bin\u01d0 h\u011bndu\u014d qi\u00e1n.
