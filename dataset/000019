Because of the small army imposed on them after World War I, the Hungarians had had to concentrate on raising the quality rather than the number of their troops, resulting in a small, but highly professional cadre. Their air force, motorised and cavalry brigades had all been substantially re-equipped with modern German and Italian equipment in the mid-1930s, and the pick of them had been assembled for the invasion of Ruthenia and the subsequent thrust into eastern Slovakia, both of which they conducted with speed and efficiency.\n\nVII Corps\nCommander-in-Chief: Major-General Andr\u00e1s Littay\n\n9th Independent Battalion (partially)\n7th Independent Battalion\n24th Independent Battalion\n8th Honved Battalion\n1st Cavalry Battalion (supported by 24 Ansaldo 35M tankettes)\n2nd Cavalry Battalion (supported by 24 Ansaldo 35M tankettes)\n2nd Motorised Battalion (supported by 5 Fiat 3000B light tanks, 22 Ansaldo 35M tankettes and 3 Crossley 29M armoured cars)\n\nThe Hungarian Air Force\nIst Group/1st Fighter Regiment\n\n1./1.V.szd.
