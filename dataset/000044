Control of Swatow and its harbour would provide a base to make the blockade of Guangdong province more effective.\n\nOrder of battle Swatow Operation\nPart of Goto Detachment and a part of Sasebo 9th SNLF landed on the east coast on June 21 near the airfield east Swatow. Other Japanese troops in more than ten motor boats \nproceeded up the Han river and landed at Mei-hsi (near modern Anbu) cutting the road between Swatow north to Chao-chow.  A coordinated attack by the Japanese drove the Chinese defenders, Hua Chen-chung's brigade and local militia units, from the city of Swatow. They fell back to the Yenfu\u2013Meihsi line on June 23. \nThe Japanese also had landed at Jiao Yu, the island south of Swatow, on June 22. They occupied the whole island by June 24.  The Chinese fell back to Fuyang on the 24th to block the approaches to Chaochow as the Japanese landed reinforcements.  Proceeding north in pursuit the Japanese also sent forces up the river and landed in the Chinese rear, part of the Chinese force then fell back into the city while the remainder moved into the mountains northwest of the city. The Japanese advancing from the west captured Chaochow by June 27 after heavy street fighting.  Later the Chinese sent reinforcements of the 5th Reserve Division, and 1st Advance Column to block the Japanese from further advances and conduct guerrilla warfare on their positions and lines of communications.\n\nReferences\nHsu Long-hsuen and Chang Ming-kai, History of The Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945) 2nd Ed.,1971.
