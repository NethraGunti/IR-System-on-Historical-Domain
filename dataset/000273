Her name is the Polish word for the common crane. \u017buraw participated in the defense of Poland during the German invasion of 1939. The ship was surrendered to the Germans following the Polish capitulation and renamed Oxh\u00f6ft as a naval trawler. Following the German surrender at the end of the war, the ship was returned to Poland under her old name. In 1947, \u017buraw was modified for use as a hydrographical survey ship and renamed Kompas. She was broken up in 1981.\n\nConstruction and career\n\u017buraw was built at the Polish Navy Shipyard (Stocznia Marynarki Wojennej) in Gdynia as a Jaskk\u00f3\u0142a-class warship minesweeper. She was named and launched on 22 September 1938.\nThe ship was rushed into service and developed problems with the steering gear, possibly because the ship was incomplete when it was put into service. She was under the command of Capt Mjr. Robert Kasperski and her homeport was at Jastarnia.\nOn 1 September 1939 the ship participated in the defense of the Hel peninsula against a massive German aerial \"carpet\" bombing attack. On 14 September 1939, \u017buraw was transferred to Hel, where the ship became part of the shoreline defense fleet. After the capitulation of the Hel peninsula on 2 October 1939, the ship anchored at Hel harbor and was confiscated by the Germans. Following this, the ship was put in the service of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine under the new German name Oxh\u00f6ft. She was initially placed in service as a trawling ship, then later converted to an auxiliary hydrographical survey ship.\nUnder the German Navy the ship underwent a retrofit with modifications of the middle section, and the guard of the fight ramp was also altered. Together with three other Polish Navy trawlers that survived the war (Mewa, Rybitwa, Czajka), \u017buraw saw service as part of the auxiliary force of German trawlers.\nAfter the war ended, the ships were recovered by the Polish Government at Travem\u00fcnde and returned to service with the Polish Navy on 25 January 1946. At Travem\u00fcnde, the Polish Flag was raised and the ship regained its former Polish name \u017buraw. On or about 13 February 1946, she was transferred to Kilonia, where new armament (5 German 20 mm cannons) and trawling equipment were added.On 12 March 1946, the trawlers, together with \u017buraw returned to Gynia Harbor, where they commenced service as the 1st Division. The warships had a mark on their sides \u017bW, which was later changed to \u017bR. In 1946 \u017buraw underwent an overhaul, and as the first of the class to return to service, began a mission on 1 November 1946 while temporarily assigned to a group of trawlers type MT. On 29 November 1946 the ship was assigned to \u015awinouj\u015bcie, to join the Szczecin sub-naval region. Beginning in December 1946, the ship went on multiple deployments and hydrographical surveying. About 14 May 1947 \u017buraw was permanently assigned to the Hydrographic Division of the Polish Navy at St. Kierzkowski and renamed Kompas. At the end of 1947 the ship underwent a modification and was retrofitted for new service, with the hydrographical survey and a design and drafting studio.\nOn or about 15 September 1948 \u017buraw was officially reclassified and converted as a hydrographical survey ship with the identification mark: HG-11. She became the first hydrographical survey ship of the Polish Navy following the end of World War II.\nOn about 1 September 1951, 12 members from the crew took over the ship and rerouted the ship to the harbor of Ystad, Sweden, where they asked for political asylum to escape the newly formed communist regime in Poland. On 3 September 1951 the ship returned to Poland with the remaining crew. This event led to a series of political trials in the Polish Navy, which ended on or about 7 November 1951 with death penalty convictions in absentia for the escaped crew members. Some of the members of the crew who returned to Poland were also convicted and received the death penalty for allowing other crew members to escape from the communist state. The Polish government declared that this was an act of treason and put down the ships name and the ship was renamed Kompas. For the ship's remaining years of the service, she served as a hydrographical survey and measurements laboratory.\nFrom 1959 to 1963 Kompas underwent a major retrofit at the Polish Navy Shipyard. At the end of December 1971 the ship was converted to a military hotel quarters barge BK-4 at Gdynia shipyard. In 1977 it was designated to salvage.\nA storm on New Year's Eve 1978/1979 broke the rigging and the ship was beached at the orchestra at basin X, and removed from active service.\nOn or about 16 July 1981, she was towed by the tugboat H-12 to the Hel peninsula and the salvage operation began.\n\nService\n1937 \u2013 laying the stump for the main haul\n22 September 1938 \u2013 waterborne\n31 September 1939(?) raising of the Polish Flag\n14 September \u2013 lowering of the Polish Flag\n2 October 1939 \u2013 1945 \u2013 captured by Germany during World War II; in service as a German warship Oxh\u00f6ft in Kriegsmarine\nsince 15 October 1945 \u2013 at Deutsche Miner\u00e4umdienststeilung\n25 January 1946 \u2013 raising of the Polish flag and return to Polish original name ORP \u017buraw.\n15 October 1948 \u2013 retro as a hydro-graphical and drafting studio service ship.\n1 September 1951 \u2013 detour of the craft to Sweden\n1951 \u2013 renaming to ORP Kompas\nDecember - Military service quarters barge BK\u20134\n1977 \u2013 end of life service cycle with salvage destination.\n31 December 1978/1 January 1979 \u2013 breaking of anchors and consequent shoring.\n1981 beginning of salvage operation.\n\nTechnical data\nDisplacements:\nStandard \u2013 183 tons,\nfull\u2013 203 tons (after retro. \u2013 300 tons)\ndimensions:\noverall length \u2013 45 m (after retro. 45.7 m)\nwidth \u2013 5.5 m (after retro. 5.5 m)\nsubmergence \u2013 1.7 m (after retro. 2.2 m)\npower plants: 2  8 cyl.
