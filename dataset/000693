It is located in the southwestern corner of  downtown Nanjing known as Jiangdongmen (\u6c5f\u4e1c\u95e8), near a site where thousands of bodies were buried, called a \"pit of ten thousand corpses\" (simplified Chinese: \u4e07\u4eba\u5751; traditional Chinese: \u842c\u4eba\u5751; pinyin: w\u00e0n r\u00e9n k\u0113ng).\n\nNanjing Massacre\nOn December 13, 1937, the Japanese Army occupied Nanjing (then spelt Nanking) \u2013 then the capital city of the Republic of China. During the first six to eight weeks of their occupation, the Japanese Army committed numerous atrocities, including rape, arson, looting, mass executions, and torture. China estimates that approximately three hundred thousand civilians and unarmed soldiers were brutally slaughtered.  This estimate was made from burial records and eyewitness accounts by the Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal and included in the verdict for Hisao Tani. Corpses littered the streets and were seen afloat in rivers for weeks, and many structures in the city were burned down. Countless shops, stores, and residences were looted and sacked.Japanese soldiers were also reported to have conducted killing competitions and bayonet practice using Chinese prisoners.  Approximately twenty thousand cases of rape occurred within the city during the first month of the occupation, according to the \"Judgement of the International Military Tribunal\". Even children, the elderly, and nuns are reported to have suffered at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\nMemorial Hall\nThe Nanjing Memorial Hall was built in 1985 by the Nanjing Municipal Government in memory of the three hundred thousand victims of the massacre. In 1995, it was enlarged and renovated. The memorial exhibits historical records and objects, and uses architecture, sculptures, and videos to illustrate what happened during the Nanjing Massacre. Many historical items were donated by Japanese members of a Japanese\u2013Chinese friendship group, which also donated a garden located on the museum grounds.\nIt occupies a total area of approximately twenty-eight thousand square meters, including about three thousand square meters of building floor space.\nThe memorial consists of three major parts: outdoor exhibits, sheltered skeletal remains of victims, and an exhibition hall of historical documents.\nAdmission is free. Visitors should prepare themselves for large crowds of people at all times of day.\n\nOutdoor exhibits\nThe outdoor exhibit include statues, sculptures, relief carvings, tablets, and a large wall listing the names of victims, as well as an atonement tablet and memorial walkway.  The memorial walkway displays footprints of survivors, some of which were impressed as recently as 2002.\n\nSkeletal remains\nThe skeletal remains of massacre victims, now exhibited in a coffin-shaped display hall, were excavated from Jiangdongmen in 1985; 208 more were uncovered in 1998.\n\nExhibition hall\nThe tomb-like exhibition hall, half underground, contains more than 1000 items related to the massacre, including an immense collection of pictures, objects, charts, and photographs. Paintings, sculptures, illuminated display cabinets, multimedia screens and documentary films serve to demonstrate to visitors the crimes committed by the Japanese military.\n\nTransportation\nThe memorial hall is accessible within walking distance west of Yunjinlu Station of Nanjing Metro.
