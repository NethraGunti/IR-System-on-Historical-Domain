In the interview, he claimed that \"killing people in war is not murder in terms of international law\" and that the Tokyo War Trial \"cannot be considered correct.\" He also equated Japanese visiting Yasukuni Shrine to Chinese visiting Confucian temples, and claimed that the Nanking Massacre is a fabrication.\nHe was promptly fired by Nakasone, as he had then still refused to apologize and withdraw his statements."}
