It was revived during the Empire of Manchukuo to describe the main administrative subdivisions of the country. The number of anto was five in 1932, corresponding to the original provinces under Qing dynasty China. The number was increased to 19 by 1941. Each anto was further divided into prefectures (four in East K\u014dan and 24 in H\u014dten). Hokuman Special Region lasted less than 3 years (July 1, 1933 - January 1, 1936) while Harbin was later incorporated into Hink\u014d Province.\n\nSee also\nHistory of the administrative divisions of China (1912\u201349)"}
