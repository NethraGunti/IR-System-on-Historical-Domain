The Manchukuo regime was established four months after the Japanese withdrawal from Shanghai with Puyi as the nominal but powerless head of state to add some semblance of legitimacy, as he was a former emperor and an ethnic Manchu.\n\nGovernment\nManchukuo was proclaimed a monarchy on 1 March 1934, with former Qing dynasty emperor Puyi assuming the Manchukuo throne under the reign name of Emperor Kang-de. An imperial rescript issued the same day, promulgated the organic law of the new state, establishing a Privy Council, a Legislative Council and the General Affairs State Council to \"advise and assist the emperor in the discharge of his duties\". The Privy Council was an appointive body consisting of Puyi's closest friends and confidants, and the Legislative Council was largely an honorary body without authority. The State Council was therefore the center of political power in Manchukuo.\n\nPolitical parties and movements\nDuring his administration, the Kangde Emperor, in an interview with foreign journalists, mentioned his interest in forming a political party with Confucian doctrines. The Japanese \"native\" establishment, however, organized some right-wing and nationalist parties, in the Militarism-Socialism mould. Such movements, which had official status, were:\n\nConcordia Association (State-sponsored political party)\nNortheast Administrative Committee (Manchukuo nationalist local party)\nRussian Fascist Organization (the White Russian fascist association in Manchukuo)\nWhite Russian Fascist Party (later the Russian Fascist Party; White Russian anticommunist party in Manchukuo, used the swastika as symbol, guided by a Russian fascist \"Duce\")\nBureau for Russian Emigrants in Manchuria (BREM) led by General Vladimir Kislitsin\nMonarquic Party (White Russian Tsarist Monarchic party with Japanese approval)\nBetarim Jew Zionist Movement (Jewish rights movement in Manchukuo)\nFar Eastern Jewish Council (Jewish Zionist council in Harbin, Manchukuo led by Dr. Abraham Kaufman, with Japanese Army support)\n\nNotable people\nThe Imperial Manchu Court\nAisin Gioro Henry Puyi (Kangde Emperor and head of state)\nElizabeth Wanrong (Empress and first wife of the Kangde Emperor)\nPrince Aisin Gioro Pujie (brother of Puyi, possible heir of Manchukuo Throne)\nPrince Aisin Gioro Puren (brother of Puyi)\nPrince Aisin Gioro Yuyan (nephew of Puyi)\nHiro Saga (Japanese sister-in-law of the Kangde Emperor)\nWenxiu (first concubine of the Emperor)\nTan Yuling (2nd Wife of the Kangde Emperor)\nLi Yuqin (4th Wife of the Kangde Emperor)\nPrincess Aisin Gioro Huisheng (daughter of Pu-Chieh and Hiro Saga)\nPrincess Aisin Gioro Xianyu (distant relative)\n\nOthers (local)\nZheng Xiaoxu, prime minister\nZhang Jinghui, next prime minister until 1945\nXi Xia (Xi Qia), cabinet minister\nMa Zhanshan, former warlord, and cabinet minister\nXie Jishi, cabinet minister\nZang Shiyi, cabinet minister\nZhang Yangqing, cabinet minister\nYu Zhishan, cabinet minister\nYuan Jinkai, cabinet minister\nL\u00fc Ronghuan, cabinet minister\nDing Jianxiu, cabinet minister\nLi Shaogeng, cabinet minister\nRuan Zhenduo, cabinet minister\nLing Sheng, cabinet minister\nSun Qichang, cabinet minister\nBao Guancheng, Manchukuo's first ambassador in Tokyo\nYuan Cheng-Tse, Manchukuo ambassador in Tokyo\nLi Shao-Keng, Manchukuo ambassador in Tokyo\nGen.
