It officially adopted the name Manchuria Aviation Company on the proclamation of the independence of Manchukuo. Major shareholders were the Manchukuo government, the South Manchurian Railway Company and the Sumitomo zaibatsu.\nFrom the beginning, the Manchuria Aviation Company was a paramilitary airline, whose primary purpose was to provide transport and logistical support for the military, and for the transport of mail. Civilian passengers were carried and charter operations undertaken on a lower priority.\nIn 1936, an \"Independent Volunteer Battalion\" of the MKKK consisting of 13 aircraft fought on the side of the Inner Mongolian Army against Kuomintang-held Suiyuan.The airline had a \"hub\" in Hsinking and was linked by regular flight routes from Harbin, Shamussi (Kiamusze), Kirin, Mukden, Antung, Chinchow, Chengde, Tsitsihar, Hailar, and the Kwantung Leased Territory and Korea areas, for connections with Imperial Japanese Airways (Dai Nippon Koku KK) to Japan itself or foreign routes. A long distance route between Hsinking and Berlin was also pioneered in 1938.\n\nThe repair shops of the MKKK produced copies of the Fokker Super Universal (Nakajima Ki-6) and the De Havilland DH.80 \"Pussmoth\"\nThe Manchuria Aviation Company ceased operations in August 1945 during the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. However, wartime fuel and equipment shortages had previously curtailed its operations considerably. Remaining aircraft, goods and equipment were confiscated, to the benefit of the Soviet Union and Chinese Communist Party, after the conflict.\n\nFleet\n30x Mansh\u016b MT-1 Hayabusa airliner\n27x de Havilland DH.80 Pussmoth\n15x Messerschmitt Bf 108A/B Taifun liaison aircraft\n12x Nakajima AT-2 Thora transports\n10x Mitsubishi MC-20 Topsy transports\n10x Junkers Ju 86Z-1 transports/bombers\n10x Junkers Ju 86Z-2 transports/bombers\n2x Heinkel He 116A communications planes\n2x Fokker F.VIIb-3m/M transports\n1x Tachikawa Ki-54 Hickory transport\n1x de Havilland DH.85 Leopardmoth\n1x General Aviation GA-43 transport\n?x Tachikawa Type LO Thelma transport (license build Lockheed Model 14-38 Super Electra)\n?x Airspeed Envoy (license build Mitsubishi Type Hinazuru transport)\n?x Mansh\u016b Super Universal (license built Fokker Super Universal)\n?x Kawasaki Ki-56 Thalia transport\n?x Kokusai Ki-59 transport\n\nAccidents and incidents\nOn June 20, 1941, Mitsubishi MC-20 (registration M-604) crashed in the Sea of Japan, killing all 18 on board.\n\nReferences\nNotes\nBibliography"}
