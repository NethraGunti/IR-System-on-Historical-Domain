He was the highest scoring tank ace of the Allies during World War II.\n\nBiography\nA descendant of Kuban Cossacks, Lavrinenko finished his training at Ulyanovsk Tank Academy in May 1938. He took part in Soviet campaigns in Poland in 1939 and Bessarabia in 1940.\nIn 1941, he commanded the new T-34/76 tank. With 58 tanks and self-propelled guns eliminated in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa on the Eastern Front of World War II, he is considered to be one of the top Soviet tank aces of the war, despite his early death in 1941. He achieved such impressive results by taking advantage of the abilities of the T-34. The tank's armor and great mobility were clearly taken into consideration by Lavrinenko.\nOn December 18, 1941, Lavrinenko was killed just after freeing the village of Goryuny and knocking out his 52nd tank. Immediately after the action the Germans began shelling the village intensively. Lavrinenko got out of his T-34 near the village and tried to reach the commander of the 17th Armoured Brigade, Lt Col N. Chernoyarov, in order to report his victory but he was killed by a German mortar shell fragment. Lavrinenko participated in 28 engagements in 2.5 months and has 52 confirmed kills. For his heroism, he was given Order of Lenin on December 22, 1941. Lavrinenko is buried in the area where he heroically fell after successfully defeating yet another attack on Moscow. After the war Marshal Mikhail Katukov along with other high generals petitioned to give Lavrinenko Hero of the Soviet Union, yet he would not receive the highest award for another half a decade.\nOn May 5, 1990, Lavrinenko was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Soviet Union.\nThe total number of tanks damaged and destroyed by Lavrinenko is comparatively small next to aces like Michael Wittmann (138 tanks and 132 anti-tank guns), Otto Carius (150 tanks), Kurt Knispel (168 tanks), and several others. However, almost all the German tank aces of the war fought from start to finish, so their overall results were more significant. Lavrinenko destroyed 52 tanks in just 2.5 months of fierce fighting in 1941. This was an outstanding result in the Soviet Army, and no single Allied tank officer surpassed him during the whole war.\n\nSee also\nMikhail Katukov.\nSemyon Krivoshein.\nPavel Rotmistrov\nMikhail Panov\nGeorgy Zhukov\nVasily Chuikov\nKonstantin Rokossovsky\nIvan Konev\nPavel Belov\nLev Dovator\nIvan Panfilov\n\nReferences\nWarHeroes.ru\n\nExternal links\nSoviet Tank Aces"}
