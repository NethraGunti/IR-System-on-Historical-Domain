It was similar to the \"Five Races Under One Union\" (Chinese: \u4e94\u65cf\u5171\u548c) motto used by the Republic of China, for the Han,  Manchus, Hui, Mongols and Tibetans, but the third of the four Chinese characters was changed from Togetherness (Chinese: \u5171) to Cooperation (Chinese: \u5354). Both mottoes were pronounced the same \"Go zoku ky\u014dwa\" in Japanese.\nThis motto was symbolized in the national flag of Manchukuo, as the yellow base color (Manchus) with four striped colors in the upper left corner: red (Japanese), blue (Han Chinese), white (Mongols) and black (Koreans).\n\nGallery\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n== References =="}
