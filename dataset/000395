He managed to recruit approximately 6,000 men, who were trained by the Japanese and organized into four infantry brigades in Japanese-occupied northern Chahar. The troops were armed with weapons seized from Northeastern Army armories and warehouses in northern China. Thag force was attached another Japanese proxy army, the Inner Mongolian Army, under the overall command of Mongol Prince Teh Wang.\nDuring the Invasion of Suiyuan the Inner Mongolian Army attacked Hongort on November 15, 1936. After several days of fighting, the attackers failed to capture the town. On November 17, a Chinese counterattack surprised the invaders and led to a disorganized retreat. Taking advantage of the disorder among the Mongolian forces, Chinese General Fu Zuoyi made a flanking movement to the west of the Mongolian headquarters at Pailingmiao, attacked and captured it, and routed the defenders. The Japanese transported Wang and his Grand Han Righteous Army by trucks into a location near Pai-ling-miao and launched a counterattack, which failed dismally on December 19. With the bulk of its men captured or killed, the Grand Han Righteous Army ceased to exist as an effective combat force, and the Japanese disbanded the remnants.\n\nSources\nJowett, Philip (2005).
