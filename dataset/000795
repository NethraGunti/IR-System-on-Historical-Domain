The newspaper was the official organ of the Russian Fascist Party. Nash Put' was published until July 1943. The newspaper promoted Christian Orthodoxy, Russian ultranationalism and fascism. Estimated circulation was 4,000. The paper was edited by Konstantin Rodzaevsky from 1933 to 1943. There was also a publishing house, \"Izdatel'stvo gazety Nash Put'\" (Russian: \u00ab\u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0433\u0430\u0437\u0435\u0442\u044b \u201e\u041d\u0430\u0448 \u041f\u0443\u0442\u044c\u201c\u00bb, \"Publisher of the newspaper Our Way\"). In 1936 it published Vladimir Kislitsin's memoirs In the fires of the Civil War: Memoires.\nIt is the source for a fabricated quote from Leon Trotsky whose source claims to be from the memoirs of Aron Simanovitch, Rasputin's secretary.\n\n\u201cThe main ally of Lenin, Bronstein-Trotsky did not hesitate at all to talk about plans and goals, We must turn Russia into a desert inhabited by white negros, whom we will give such a tyranny that the most terrible despots of the East never dreamed of. The only difference is that this tyranny will not be on the right, but on the left, and not white, but red. In the literal sense of the word, red, for we will shed such streams of blood, before which all the human losses of capitalist wars will shudder and pale. The largest bankers overseas will work closely with us. If we win the revolution, crush Russia, then on its burial debris we will strengthen the power of Zionism and become such a force before which the whole world will kneel. We will show you what real power is. By terror blood baths, we will bring the Russian intelligentsia to complete dullness, to idiocy, to an animal state ... \"\n\nReferences\nSources\nThe Russian Fascists: Tragedy and Farce in Exile, 1925-1945 by John J.
