It depicts Volga German refugees persecuted by the Bolsheviks on the Sino-Russian border in Manchuria in 1928.The screenplay was written by Gerhard Menzel and was based on his own novel of the same title. It was shot at the Babelsberg Studios with sets designed by the art directors Robert Herlth and Walter R\u00f6hrig.It was the first movie to win the state prize, and Goebbels praised it as among those films that, while they did not explicitly cite National Socialist principles, nevertheless embodied its spirit, a new film reflecting the ideal of their national revolution.The refugees are rescued by a heroic German leader much like the F\u00fchrer; the symbolism is obviously intended to emulate Adolf Hitler although its hero, being blond and athletic, represented the physical ideal much more clearly. He is disgusted by \"November Germany\", and devotes himself to the ideal of \"true Germany\". He off-handedly disposes of some refugees as worthless, and demands complete obedience from all others. The death of a boy deeply devoted to him moves him, as dying for a cause is something he would wish for himself, in keeping with Nazi glorification of heroic death.Their Communist persecutors are portrayed simply as brutal murderers, typical of works prior to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact (and again after its breach). The film was shown for some time after the pact, owing to bureaucratic oversight, complicating the efforts of Nazi propaganda.The movie is mostly set in the city of Harbin, in what was at the time the Republic of China.\n\nCast\nHans Albers as Arneth\nK\u00e4the von Nagy as Kristja Laudy\nEugen Kl\u00f6pfer as Bernhard Laudy\nAndrews Engelmann as The Commissar\nFritz Genschow as Hermann, refugee-engineer\nKarl Rainer as Peter, teenage refugee\nFranziska Kinz as Pregnant woman\nIda W\u00fcst as Frau Megele\nVeit Harlan as Mannlinger\nKarl Meixner as Pappel\nHans Adalbert Schlettow as Siberian\nFriedrich Gna\u00df as Hussar\nHans Hermann Schaufuss as Zweig\nJosef Dahmen as Man with red hair\nCarsta L\u00f6ck as Frau Hellerle\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nGiesen, Rolf.
