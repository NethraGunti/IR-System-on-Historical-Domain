It was fought between 14 and 18 September 1939, between the German XIX Panzer Corps of General Heinz Guderian and the improvised Polish 60th Infantry Division \"Kobryn\" of Colonel Adam Epler. It was fought concurrently with the Battle of Brze\u015b\u0107 Litewski.\n\nEve of the battle\nFor a detailed description of the situation prior to the battle see: Battle of Brze\u015b\u0107\nAfter breaking through the Polish defences in the Battle of Wizna, the German forces under General Heinz Guderian started to make their way towards Brze\u015b\u0107, Kowel and Kobry\u0144. Their aim was to cut the Polish territory in two parts and paralyse the Polish attempts to organise a line of defence east of the Bug River.\n\nBattle\nOn 14 September 1939, elements of the XIX Panzer Corps reached the area of Brze\u015b\u0107 and Kobry\u0144. Brze\u015b\u0107 was defended by a small force under General Konstanty Plisowski, while Kobry\u0144 was defended by the improvised 60th Infantry Division of Colonel Adam Epler.\nIn the early morning of 14 September Colonel Epler received a report of German forces entering the area. Elements of the German XIX Panzer Corps (elements of 3rd Panzer Division and entire 2nd Motorised Infantry Division) were advancing rapidly and Epler suspected that the Germans would advance on the towns of Brze\u015b\u0107 and Kobry\u0144, as well as toward an important railway node located in the village of \u017babinka. To probe the enemy forces, he ordered the 2nd battalion of his 84th Infantry Regiment to commence a delaying action in the area of \u017babinka train station and the villages of Tewela and Ogrodniki. At the same time, the 2nd battalion of 83rd Infantry Regiment was ordered to organise a defensive line along the swampy shores of Tro\u015bcianica river to cover the eastern flank of the Polish forces in the area of Brze\u015b\u0107, some 30 kilometres westward.\nOn 15 September the German 3rd Armoured Division encountered and destroyed a column of the 9th reserve light artillery depot. However, Epler's forces were not spotted until late evening of that day, when they were bombarded by the Luftwaffe. The following day the main force of the German XIX Corps arrived. The 2nd Battalion of the 84th Infantry Regiment together with an armoured train organised an ambush and attacked the Germans who were supported by a battery of artillery. Following six hours of combat, the Germans were forced to retreat with significant casualties. The Polish battalion seized several guns and tanks, but had to burn them due to lack of fuel and then retreated toward the main line of Polish defenses.\nAt dawn on 17 September 1939 the reconnaissance units of the German 2nd Motorised Infantry Division finally reached the Polish lines. After a short skirmish, the Poles withdrew behind the defensive positions guarded by the 2nd battalion of the 83rd Infantry Regiment. The Germans then tried to outflank the Poles by attacking the cemetery in the village of Chwedkowice, but were repelled with light losses, mostly due to direct fire from the Polish 100mm howitzers. The 2nd Motorised Division lost three or four armoured cars and was forced to retreat. The Polish battalion withdrew towards the village of Piaski, where it organised another ambush. In the afternoon it was again attacked by the elements of German 2nd Motorised Division, but this assault was also repelled.\n17 September also marked the beginning of the Soviet invasion of Poland.\nOvernight, the Polish forces fighting in the Battle of Brze\u015b\u0107 were withdrawn to the other side of the Bug River and joined the forces of Independent Operational Group Polesie under General Franciszek Kleeberg. Elements of the Polish forces arrived at Kobry\u0144, but the defense of the area lost much of its strategic significance. Colonel Epler decided to defend the area as long as possible, and then retreat southwards, following the General Kleeberg's forces.\nThe main battle for Kobry\u0144 began on 18 September 1939. Early in the fighting, the Germans managed to capture the Gubernia I and Gubernia II manorial farms, which were protecting the road to Bereza Kartuska and closing the approach to main forces of the Polish division. A counterattack by Polish forces from Kobry\u0144 forced the retreat of the Germans from one of the manorial farms, but it was later recaptured. Fierce combat broke out near the Queen Bona Canal. The Germans were unable to seize complete control of Kobry\u0144 on September 18 because of Polish army resistance, resulting in an impasse.\nDuring the day, Polish patrols and units of the eastern wing of Independent Operational Group \"Polesie\" came into contact with advanced units of the Soviet Army 23rd Rifle Corps in the area of \u0141uniniec.Faced with the knowledge of the broader Soviet Invasion of Poland pouring in from the frontline and specific reports from units of IOG \"Polesie\" encountering advanced units of Red Army forces, General Franciszek Kleeberg amalgamated all units of IOG \"Polesie\" under his command with the improvised 60th Infantry Division and withdrew to the South towards the Pinsk Marshes in the area of Dywin. The headquarters of GO \"Polesie\" was relocated from Pi\u0144sk to Lubiesz\u00f3w, at present Lubeshiv in Ukraine.\nWith the withdrawal of Polish forces, the battle for Kobry\u0144 came to an end.\n\n\n== References =="}
