Located in at Ryojun 38\u00b048\u203245\u2033N 121\u00b014\u203230\u2033E), (present-day L\u00fcshunkou, China, The Ryojun Guard District was responsible for control of the strategic seaward approaches to Manchukuo and to north China and for patrols in the Yellow Sea and along the China coastlines. It was disbanded in 1943.\n\nHistory\nThe Guard Districts (\u8b66\u5099\u5e9c, Keibifu) were second tier naval bases, similar to the first tier Naval Districts (\u93ae\u5b88\u5e9c), with docking, fueling and resupply facilities, but typically lacked a shipyard or training school. They tended to be established by strategic waterways or major port cities for defensive purposes. In concept, the Guard District was similar to the United States Navy Sea Frontiers concept. the Guard District maintained a small garrison force of ships and Naval Land Forces which reported directly to the Guard District commander, and hosted detachments of the numbered fleets on a temporary assignment basis.\nThe port of Ryojun on the Kwantung Peninsula was an area with a long association with the Imperial Japanese Navy, having been first seized during the First Sino-Japanese War in December 1894. Japan was forced to abandon the port due to the Triple Intervention in February 1896, and its port facilities were soon occupied and developed by the Imperial Russian Navy as Port Arthur, Russia\u2019s most important naval base in the Far East.\nThe Russian naval base was seized by Japan after the Battle of Port Arthur in August 1904 and was proclaimed the Ryojun Naval District (\u9f8d\u9806\u93ae\u5b88\u5e9c). However, it lacked the shipyards, armories and the training facilities associated with other naval districts, (for which it relied on Sasebo Naval District).  Tasked primarily with coastal patrols of the Liaodong Peninsula and control of the strategic seaward approaches to Tianjin and Beijing, it was regarded as a prestigious posting, with its commander receiving his commission directly from the Emperor.\nHowever, on March 14, 1914, the status of the Ryojun Naval District was reduced to that of a third echelon naval port, or y\u014dk\u014dbu (\u8981\u6e2f\u90e8). It served as a staging point and refueling base in World War I for operations against the Imperial German Navy\u2019s German East Asia Squadron based out of Tsingtao. With the Allied victory in World War I eliminating the German threat and with the Washington Naval Treaty limiting naval forces, Ryojun Military Port was deactivated on December 1, 1922.\nIn April 1933, the base was reactivated, and its role expanding to include patrols and guard of the coastline of Manchukuo. On November 20, 1941 in anticipation of the coming war with the United States, Ryojun was upgraded to Guard District status.\nHowever, on January 15, 1942, with Japan in full control of the seaward approaches to China and Manchukuo, the Guard District was again deactivated.\n\nOrder of Battle at time of the attack on Pearl Harbor\nRyojun Guard District\nMinesweeper Division 32\nShanan Maru #16\n\nList of commanders\nCommanding officer\nChief of Staff\n\nReferences\nPrados, John (1995).
