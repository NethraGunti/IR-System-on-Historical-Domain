After graduation, he ran for the Miyazaki prefecture assembly, and was elected three terms.\nA conservative politician, Takami Et\u014d joined in 1973 the political club Seirankai (\u9752\u5d50\u4f1a - 'Mountain wind') founded by Shintaro Ishihara, one of Japan's most prominent \"far right\" politicians. He was called \"Japan's Le Pen\" on a program broadcast on Australia's ABC.Eto was once considered a major power broker in Japan's Liberal Democratic Party.Eto served as the Japanese construction minister during the early 1990s, but resigned from the Management and Coordination Agency in 1995 following controversial comments regarding Japan's treatment of occupied countries during World War II.Et\u014d retired from politics in 2003.Takami Et\u014d was found dead in his hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, on November 22, 2007. He was 82 years old when he died and had been in Vietnam on a private agriculturally related visit. Japan's Kyodo News reported that Et\u014d had died of an apparent heart attack.\n\nHistorical revisionism, negationism\nEt\u014d was known for his revisionist views, and his negation of the existence of Japanese war crimes. He resigned from his post as minister in 1995 following comments in which he stated that Japan \"did some good things\" when it governed Korea, including building railroads, roads and schools. Et\u014d's comments threatened to cancel an important summit between South Korea's then President Kim Young-sam, whose government objected to Et\u014d's comments, and then Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, a socialist who led Japan's coalition government, before Et\u014d's resignation.Additionally, Et\u014d defended the 1910 Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty which gave Japan control over Korea. He stated in a speech, \"Why was the country-to-country treaty called an invasion?...What's the difference between that and a merger of a town and a village?\" Et\u014d also actively lobbied against school textbooks which mentioned so-called \"comfort women\" Comfort women were women from across Asia, including Koreans, whom Japanese troops forced into sexual slavery during World War II.Et\u014d also denied the existence of the Nanking massacre, which he considered as a hoax.\n\nTransmission of power and views to his son\nTakami Et\u014d's son, Taku Et\u014d, took his father's seat in the House of Representatives of Japan. Taku Eto is affiliated to the openly revisionist lobby Nippon Kaigi, which advocates a restoration of monarchy in the archipelago and negates the existence of Japanese war crimes. He was among the 86 MPs invited to the meeting for the 'one million people rally to protect the Imperial tradition' in March 2006, and among the people who signed 'THE FACTS', an ad published in the Washington Post on June 14, 2007 in order to protest against United States House of Representatives House Resolution 121, and to deny the existence of sexual slavery for the Imperial military ('Comfort women').\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nTakami Et\u014d obituary (in Japanese)"}
