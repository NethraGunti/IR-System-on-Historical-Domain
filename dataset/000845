He pitched many innings in his high school career. The Japan High School Baseball Federation was afraid that he would injure his arm, so they set a new rematch rule in 1958. However, he pitched 18 innings in a 1958 quarterfinal game, which resulted in the first rematch in the National High School Baseball Championship. He reached the final, but didn't win. His record of 83 strikeouts in the tournament remains unbroken. He joined Chunichi Dragons but it is said that he didn't regain his pitching strength. He can't extend his elbow even now.\n\nWorks\nSingles\n\"Moeyo Dragons!\" \u2013 1974\n\nInformation\nDoy\u014d Daisuki! 830 (Kansai TV) \u2013 1987\u20131997\n\nVariety show\nSunday Dragons (CBC) \u2013 1983\u2013\u2013present\nUnbelievable (Fuji TV) \u2013 1997\u20131998\n\nGame show\nSekai Fushigi Hakken!
