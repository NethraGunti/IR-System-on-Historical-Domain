The organization included German minority organizations from northern Poland, such as the \"Block of Unity\" operating in Pozna\u0144, \"Young German Block\" from Grudzi\u0105dz and the \"German Central Election Commission\" operating in Pomerania. Within 1,5 year, 150 branches were established, and by May 1934, the DV already had 16,474 members. At the turn of 1935/36, the number of members increased to 27,804. In the spring of 1939, the DV had about 35,000 members in the provinces of Pozna\u0144 and Pomerania, which made it the second largest organization of the German minority in Poland. Organizationally, the DV, like other German organizations in pre-war Poland, was subject to the Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle, headed by Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Werner Lorenz. DV published three newspapers, \"Deutsche Rundschau in Polen\" (Bydgoszcz), \"Posener Tageblatt\" (Pozna\u0144) and \"Pommereller Tageblatt\" (Tczew), which met primarily the goals of agitation. The German Union competed with another organization of the German minority in Poland - the Jungdeutsche Partei. On January 21, 1940, the German Union was dissolved.\n\nBloody Sunday\nOn September 4, 1939 during the Bydgoszcz bloody Sunday, German saboteurs in the village of Pr\u0105dy (Bydgoszcz County) fired on withdrawing units of the Polish 15th Infantry Division, in retaliation, 15 Germans were shot (including Ferdinand Dreger, Gustav Dreger, Gustav Rudolf Kopiske, Ferdinand Giese).\n\nUniforms and symbols\nDuring the meetings the members of DV wore a uniform outfit consisting of black pants or a skirt, a white shirt and a black tie. Wearing these clothes in public places was forbidden and resulted in a fine for the infringement. The DV sign was a white arrow on the black background - the Tiwaz.\n\nSee also\nDeutscher Volksverband, the German minority organization from central Poland\nJungdeutsche Partei, the German minority organization operating throughout Poland\n\n\n== Notes and references =="}
