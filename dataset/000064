Those trained became the nucleus of the Haganah, which itself became the main constituent of the Israel Defense Forces during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. \nThe other branch of the Notrim was an \u00e9lite mobile force, created in 1938, known as the Jewish Settlement Police.\n\nSee also\nNotrim\n\nFootnotes\nReferences\nBowyer Bell, John (1996).
