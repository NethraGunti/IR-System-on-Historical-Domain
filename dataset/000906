Ten were built by Kawasaki (works nos. 970\u2212971, 1140\u22121170) and six by Kisha Seiz\u014d (w/n 965\u2212970), and though very similar to the Japanese D50 class, there were some slight differences in dimensions due to the larger loading gauge on Chinese lines.\nAfter the establishment of Manchukuo, the Jichang Jidun Railway was nationalised along with other private railways to form the Manchukuo National Railway. These locomotives were classified by MNR to Mikana (\u30b7\u30ab\u30ca) class, numbered 6540\u22126555, renumbered 501\u2212516 in 1938.\n\nPostwar\nAfter the end of the Pacific War, these locomotives were passed on to the Republic of China Railway. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, China Railways designated them \u3107\u310e5 (MK5) class in 1951, and subsequently \u89e3\u653e5 (JF5) class in 1959.\nThe last of these locomotives were retired in 1990.\n\n\n== References =="}
