As a result, the nearby 8th Route Army refused to commit more than a token force to assist the surrounded Nationalists. South Shanxi would later be remembered in China as one of the worst defeats of the entire war.\n\nOrder of battle\nChinese\n1st War Area \u2013 Wei Li-huang\n5th Army Group \u2013 Zeng Wan-zhong3rd Corps \u2013 Tang Huai-yuan7th Division\n12th Division\n80th Corps \u2013 Kong Ling-xun165th Division\nNew 27th Division\n34th Division \u2013 Kung Ping-fan\n14th Army Group \u2013 Liu Mao-en15th Corps \u2013 Wu Ting-lin64th Division\n65th Division\n98th Corps \u2013 Wu Shi-ming42nd Division\n169th Division\n9th Corps \u2013 Pei Chang-hui47th Division\n54th Division\nNew 24th Division\n17th Corps \u2013 Gao Gui-zi84th Division\nNew 2nd Division\n43rd Corps \u2013 Zhao Shi-ling *\n70th Division\nNew 47th Division\n14th Corps \u2013 Chen Tie85th Division\n94th Division\n93rd Corps \u2013 Liu Kan10th DivisionNotes:\n\n43rd Corps was formerly with 2nd War Area.Sources:\n\n[1] Hsu Long-hsuen and Chang Ming-kai, History of The Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) 2nd Ed., 1971.
