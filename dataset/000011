These bombings were probably aimed at cowing the Chinese government, or as part of the planned but never executed Sichuan invasion.\n\nOpposing forces\nThe centralized Chinese Air Force initially equipped at the outbreak of the air war in 1937 with largely US-made aircraft and training, as well as aircraft and training from other foreign sources, including Italian and Japanese army air force instructors, plus the addition of many former Chinese warlord air force men and machines, and numerous Chinese-American aviators volunteering for service with the Chinese Air Force, had suffered severe losses through attrition from the Battle of Shanghai/Fall of Nanking/Fall of Taiyuan by the end of 1937, to the Fall of Wuhan by the end of 1938. As China was not an aviation industrial power at the time, and with the war progressing with little replenishment to the equipment of the Chinese Air Force units, the Chinese found new hope from the lifeline of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of 1937; the Chinese Air Force pilots had almost completely transitioned into Soviet-made Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 series of fighter-pursuit aircraft by early 1938, along with a few remaining Curtiss Hawk IIIs that was China's frontline fighter-attack weapon of choice when war began in 1937, along with several Dewoitine D.510 fighters left by the defunct French Volunteer Group (the 41st PS) which was disbanded in October of 1938. However, with the ever increasing Japanese blockade of imports into China, particularly after Chongqing was cut-off from sea-access after losing Nanning in the Battle of South Guangxi, and with war looming in Europe, the supplies needed by the Chinese were barely trickling in, and the Chinese Air Force had to make do with the increasingly poor flying performance and maintenance problems of these Soviet-made fighters burning low-grade 65-75 octane fuel in the first few years defending Chongqing and Chengdu while massive formations of Japanese aircraft benefitting from great technological advancements and burning 90+ octane fuel were flying ever faster and higher, practically beyond the reach of the obsolescent Chinese fighter aircraft; the British Royal Air Force for example were supplied directly by their own aircraft industry while benefitting from tremendous improvements in their fighter aircraft speed and acceleration performance by upgrading from the standard 87 octane fuel to the \"secret 100 octane\" formula later in the Battle of Britain. Among the primary and auxiliary airbases used by the Chinese Air Force in the Chongqing and Chengdu defense sector; Baishiyi Airbase, Fenghuangshan, Guangyangba, Liangshan, Shuangliu, Suining, Taipingsi, Wenjiang, Xinjin, among others. There were 18 primary anti-aircraft artillery batteries positioned around Chongqing from 1939 to 1942, not including the air force's anti-aircraft gun units assigned specifically for the defense of the airbases.\nAs the Chinese government fell-back and engaged the Japanese advances in new frontline operations in the beginning of 1938 at Wuhan, Taierzhuang, Guangdong and other main battle lines, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force began harassing the deep-rear with exploratory strikes against the anticipated national fortress of Chongqing, with the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Force hitting hard at the frontlines in Wuhan. The exploratory strikes on Chongqing began on 18 February 1938, and continued sporadically at relatively low-intensity until the commencement of Operation 100 on 3 May 1939, when airbases of newly-captured territories, specifically in Hubei province including Wuhan, allowed the Japanese to establish airbases and logistics to stage a sustained campaign of massively coordinated joint-strikes with the IJNAF heavy-bomber units. The introduction of the Zero-sen fighter plane in 1940, the most advanced fighter aircraft produced at the time, ensured the Japanese practically total air supremacy. U.S. support for China had begun in earnest in 1941 following the Japanese invasion of French Indochina, with the oil and steel embargo against Japan, and consequently, the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor; beginning in 1942, barrels of 100-octane avgas began to increasingly trickle into China over the cross-Himalayan air-route known as \"The Hump\" (mostly destined for USAAF operations), and the Chinese Air Force were provided with new American Republic P-43 Lancer pursuit planes, which in theory with its very fast high-altitude performance and good firepower from its 4X 50-caliber machine guns, was quite the upgrade the Chinese Air Force needed to effectively hit back at the Japanese raiders, but it was proven to be extremely unreliable and may have killed more of its own pilots than the enemies, including veteran pilot and 4th PG CO Major Zheng Shaoyu whose P-43 caught fire during a ferrying flight back to combat operations in China and was killed in the ensuing crash. The majority of the Japanese air raids conducted against Chongqing were made with squadrons of medium-heavy bombers composed of Mitsubishi G3M variants, known under Allied codename \"Nells\", Ki-21s \"Sallys\", Fiat BR.20 Cicognas (\"Ruths\"), and Ki-48 \"Lilys\"; prior to the departure of the crack Japanese Naval Air units in China for the Pacific War in mid-late 1941, the new successor to the G3M bomber, the G4M \"Bettys\" were operationally tested in the bombing of Chongqing, followed by newer designs including the Ki-67 \"Peggys\", Ki-49 \"Helens\", and P1Y \"Frances\" (successor to the G4M) were deployed in the following years as the terror bombings of Chongqing continued.\n\nRaids\nIn the first two days of the Operation 100 bombing campaign, 54 and 27 Japanese bombers raided Chongqing on 03 and 04 of May 1939 respectively, dropping approximately a 3:2 ratio of Type 98/25 HE land bombs and Type 98/7 incendiary bombs, killing almost four thousand civilians, injuring over 2,300, leaving about 200,000 homeless (most deaths by far occurring in the 04 May predawn raid which at the time precluded the interception of the bombers); Major Deng Mingde led the 22nd PS, 4th PG squadron of Polikarpov fighters against the formation of 54 bombers on the first day while shooting down 7, however losing two pilots including his deputy commander and veteran Zhang Mingsheng, who was shot down and while parachuting to safety, died of his wounds.Two months later, after tens of thousands of deaths, in retaliation for firebombing, the United States embargoed the export of airplane parts to Japan, thus imposing its first economic sanction against that nation.The Japanese began to embark nighttime bombing raids against Chongqing in summer of 1939 in effort to reduce confrontation and casualties from defending Chinese Air Force fighters, however the Chinese pilots had some success in shooting-down the nighttime bombers using \"lone wolf\" fighter tactics previously deployed during the Battle of Nanking two years earlier (and similar to the Wilde Sau tactics the Luftwaffe will deploy a few years later), and involves the coordination with a series of manually-operated ground based searchlights illuminating and tracking incoming bombers which can then be seen and targeted by the solitary fighter pilot; fighter ace Liu Zhesheng shot down a bomber in the night of 3 August, 1939 over Chonqing flying \"lone wolf\" in an I-15 during nighttime intercept mission, among several kills he participated in claiming while battling in defense of Chongqing. In the following night, Capt. Cen Zeliu would also claim a nighttime-kill of a bomber while at the controls of an I-15bis.By mid-1940, the IJN G3M Model 21 bombers that formed the primary aircraft of the carpet-bombing campaign against Chonqing and Chengdu, have become largely relegated to nighttime bombing attacks while daylight raids were being replaced with the new and improved Model 22/23 G3Ms equipped with the higher-octane rated and supercharged Kinsei 51 engines, boosting the power of each of the twin-engined bombers by 500-horsepower and greatly enabling the schnellbomber strategy further above the general obsolescence of the defending Chinese fighter aircraft now struggling to gain speed and altitude to make even a single head-on pass against the high-speed/high-altitude, and vulnerable to the massed-firepower of the heavy bomber formations.\ufffcAlso by mid-1940, the Japanese had employed new tactics to stave-off attacks from defending Chinese fighter aircraft; Chinese air raid early warning net would alert the Chinese Air Force to scramble their fighters towards Japanese bombers approaching Chongqing, however, all this is being monitored by a high-speed IJNAF C5M (IJAAF designation Ki-15) scouting-attack plane at high-altitude which would then radio instructions to the bombers to circle out of range as the Chinese fighters rose to meet the bombers, and allowing the Chinese fighters to run low on fuel and forcing them to return to base for refueling, after which the reconnaissance plane redirects the bombers to attack the Chinese fighters on the ground refueling. While the Chinese cracked the code used by the C5M crews relaying messages to the bomber formations, some of the countermeasures used by the Chinese pilots were to launch a pair of I-16 that were almost fast enough to intercept the C5M in pursuit, but enough to force the scouts away, while a second flight of fighters were launched against returning Japanese bombers as the first flight of Chinese interceptors returned to disperse in smaller auxiliary airbases to refuel, although successful interceptions were still limited as the Polikarpovs struggled to engage the new Model 22/23 G3Ms in particular.A C5M and three G3Ms were shot down over eastern Chongqing on 20 May 1940 by the 24th PS, 4th PG equipped with the few (10 in total) ShVAK 20mm cannon-armed I-16 Type 17 fighters that were available in the Chinese Air Force inventory; unfortunately two of the I-16 Type 17s were put out of action following the battle, having been shot-up by the defensive fire from the Japanese raiders and making forced-landings.The Japanese air raids against Chongqing had become increasingly intense and destructive as the \"joint air strike force\" of IJAAF and IJNAF bomber formations began to comprise upwards of 150-200 bombers per raid under the new codename \"Operation 101\", and massive defensive machine gun fire from the bombers were very effective against slow Chinese fighter aircraft which were further handicapped with burning low-grade fuel, much of which mostly came by way of French Indochina and mixed with local sources. The Japanese warned foreign emissaries in Chongqing to avoid being hit as collateral damage under the massed carpet-bombings by moving to pre-defined \"secure areas\" which would be exempt from bombing; a large Nazi flag was emblazoned on the roof of the German embassy in Chongqing (but was still hit by a Japanese bomber strike). Following the defeat of France by Germany in June of 1940, the French Vichy Government submitted to the demands of the Japanese, by allowing Japanese troops to conduct cross-border raids into Yunnan province, and the stationing of Japanese army air units at three airbases in Vietnam, including L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n.On 10, 12 and 16 June 1940, the Japanese raided Chongqing with 129, 154 and 114 bombers on these days respectively, while the Chinese I-15 and I-16 fighter squadrons engaged these attacks shooting down 13 of the raiders, perhaps more importantly, forcing bombers to miss their targets, although these disrupted flights of bombers may evade the Chinese fighters, and divert out to drop bombs on secondary targets, including other large population areas such as Ziliujing and Luxian. The Chinese would be dealt with a serious blow a few weeks later in July of 1940 when the British closed the Burma Road (the same timeframe as the beginning of the Battle of Britain), which was China's primary lifeline for material and fuel needed in the defense of Chongqing and Chengdu.On 11 August 1940, 4th PG CO Maj. Zheng Shaoyu personally selected a team of five of his top fighter pilots, including ace fighter pilot Capt. Liu Zhesheng and future-ace Lt. Gao Youxin to deploy a new weapon in an experiment to help with the dispersal and attacks against the massive Japanese bomber formations; multiple air burst bombs developed by combat flight instructor Yan Lei at the Central Air Force Academy at the Wujiaba Airbase. At 13:56 hours that day, 90 G3M bombers appeared in two waves, and Maj. Zheng's team, with ample preparations, maneuvered high and above the approaching bomber formation with precision flying while the Japanese aircrews observed the unusual movements of the Chinese fighters, which soon dropped the air-burst devices that descended under parachutes, and detonating just a few hundred meters in front of the lead bombers, resulting in a breakup of the bomber formation followed by furious attacks from the Chinese fighter pilots the best they could with the handicap of the highly challenged performance and firepower of the Polikarpovs, shooting down two (five claimed) and damaging many others; eight Chinese fighters suffered various degrees of damage while the wreckages of Japanese bombers were found in Shichuxian and Shuangqing with three of the seven-man crew in one of the bombers found alive and taken prisoner.The state-of-the-art new Japanese A6M Zero fighters were first deployed into combat in course of the Chongqing and Chengdu bombing raids, and received its first baptism of fire in aerial combat on 13 September 1940; 13 Zeroes of the 12th Kokutai led by Lieutenant Saburo Shindo escorting 27 G3M bombers on a raid into Chongqing were met with 34 Chinese Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 fighters commanded by Maj. Louie Yim-qun, Maj. Zheng Shaoyu, Capt. Yang Mengjing and Capt. Zhang Hong whom engaged the Zero fighters in a 1/2-hour long dogfight, and while suffering the huge loss of most of the Polikarpovs getting shot down (the Zero pilots claiming \"all 27 Polikarpovs shot down\"), with ten pilots killed in action, and eight wounded, Lt. Gao Youxin managed to shoot Zeroes off the tails of other Chinese fighters, and claiming a Zero shot-down, but in fact only 4 Zeroes suffered from some damage, and all 13 Zeroes survived and safely returned to base in Wuhan.As the already-desperate situation now irrefutable with the scourge of the new Zero fighter, the Chinese Air Force high-command issued an all-points bulletin to avoid combat engagement against the new air-superiority fighter, however, Chinese fighters would continue with fatalistic courage to face the Zero on numerous occasions, including another large-scale dogfight over Chengdu on 14 March 1941, that saw the Japanese Zero fighters employ new tactics to avoid near-deadly mistakes from the 13 September 1940 air-battle experience; the pitched dogfight over Chengdu was another devastating dark day in the tragic chapters of the Chinese Air Force in the war, as eight pilots were killed, including top-ace fighter pilots Maj. John Huang Xinrui and Capt. Cen Zeliu, along with the young 2Lt. Lin Heng (younger brother of renown architect Phyllis Lin Huiyin).In response to the Japanese invasion of French Indochina in late-1940/early-1941, the Empire of Japan was finally met with earnest U.S. scrap metal and oil embargo against Japan, and the freezing of Japanese assets in summer of 1941.On 5 June 1941, in midst of the increased brutality of the new \"Operation 102\" to capitulate the China's war of resistance, the Japanese flew more than 20 sorties, bombing the city for three hours. About 4,000 residents who hid in a tunnel were asphyxiated. With the start of full-scale war between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany on 22 June 1941, and with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek looking for increased support from the Americans through the Lend-Lease Act, all new fighter aircraft produced by the Soviets were now directed to the battlefronts against Nazi Germany, where the I-15/153, I-16 and the Ilyushin Il-2 fed the exorbitant aerial-kill claims by the Luftwaffe.On 11 August 1941, in what would be the last-recorded dogfight between the Chinese Air Force and the IJN Zeroes before all active Zero squadrons were pulled out of China in preparations with Operation Z (the Pearl Harbor attack mission), future Japanese ace-fighter pilots Gitaro Miyazaki and Saburo Sakai were part of the escort of an Operation 102 bomber-attack and sweep of Chinese air bases between Chongqing and Chengdu, and encountered Chinese I-153 and I-16 fighters at Wenjiang Airbase; while shooting down all those that managed to take off or strafing those still taxiing down the runways, Saburo Sakai described how five Zeroes struggled to shoot down the one last opponent still in the air that \"was an absolute master\" as it \"snap-rolled, spiralled, looped and turned through seemingly impossible maneuvers... like a wraith\", but Sakai himself only managing to finally shoot down the acrobatic biplane when it was forced to slow-roll while clearing over the top of a hill west of Chengdu; the belly of the Chinese fighter exposed right into the sights of Sakai's Zero, who fired cannon shells that \"tore through the floorboards of the biplane\". Four Chinese pilots were killed in this engagement, including Lt. Huang Rongfa, whose fiancee, named Ms. Yang Quanfang, took a pistol and shot herself at the memorial for him and the other martyrs on the 16 of August; under these special circumstances, Ms. Yang and Lt. Huang were buried together at the Chongqing Nanshan Air Force Martyrs Memorial Park.Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the United States declared war on Japan, and President Roosevelt sought an immediate counterattack for the humiliation of Pearl Harbor; in the urgency to keep China resupplied for the new Sino-US joint effort in the war against Japan, General Joseph Stillwell was sent to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek on a top secret arrangement for transferring of B-25 Mitchell bomber support equipment, radio-homing navigational aids and 100-octane avgas into China to support the planning of what was to become the Doolittle Raid against the Japanese home islands. The badly needed high-octane avgas in China for the renewed war effort against the Empire of Japan were now increasingly being shipped via the risky Himalayan air-route known as \"The Hump\". Although Japan's focus have shifted towards the Pacific campaign, and much of the Japanese aerial-combat assets had been diverted to support the war in the Pacific, which curtailed the offensive campaign against Chonqing and Chengdu, modern interceptor aircraft possessing far greater speed and firepower, ground-based radar equipment, and new aircrew training supplied by the US and allied partners allowed the Chinese Air Force to be in a much better position to fight back by August 1943. The last recorded air raid of the campaign took place on 19 December 1944.\n\nTotal bomb tonnage and raids\nThree-thousand tons of bombs were dropped on the city between 1939 and 1942. According to photographer Carl Mydans, the spring 1941 bombings were at the time \"the most destructive shelling ever made on a city\", although terror bombing grew rapidly during the Second World War: by comparison 2,300 tons of bombs were dropped by Allied bombers on Berlin in a single night during the Battle of Berlin. A total of 268 air raids were conducted against Chongqing.\n\nLawsuit against the Japanese government\nIn March 2006, 40 Chinese who were wounded or lost family members during the bombings sued the Japanese government, demanding 10,000,000 yen (628,973 yuan) each, and asked for apologies. \"By filing a lawsuit, we want the Japanese people to know about Chongqing bombings,\" said a victim. By 2015, over 180 Chongqing bombing survivors, including Lu Xianbo and Chen Guifang, have attempted to sue Japan for the war crimes in Japanese courts, seeking compensation and an official apology; a Tokyo District Court ruled against them, Chongqing victims group has vowed to keep pursuing the case, which is really not about monetary compensation, but more about getting official validation of what they suffered through.\n\nGallery\nReferences\n\nBibliography"}
