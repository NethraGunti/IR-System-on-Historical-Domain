It was a diary of her time with the Chinese Communist Eighth Route Army in the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War.\nReleased in the United States and Great Britain, it was much less successful than her earlier China books.  Smedley included some of the same material in a later book, Battle Hymn of China, which did much better.\n\n\n== References =="}
