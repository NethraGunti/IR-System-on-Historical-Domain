She was born in the Aisin Gioro clan, the imperial clan of the Qing dynasty. She is the younger daughter of Pujie, the younger brother of Puyi, the last emperor of China, and her mother was Hiro Saga, a Japanese noblewoman.\n\nBiography\nShe was born Aisin-Gioro Husheng at Juntendo University Hospital in Tokyo, Japan on 13 March 1940 to Pujie and Hiro Saga. Her elder sister was Huisheng who was born earlier in Hsinking, Manchukuo in 1938. In June of the same year, her family moved back to Manchukuo.\nFollowing the surrender of Japan in 1945, the Japanese puppet state Manchukuo collapsed and the Soviet Red Army occupied Northeast China. Husheng's father was captured by the Red Army and was first held in a prison camp in Chita. While trying to escape to Korea by train, Husheng, her mother and aunt Wanrong were captured by the Chinese Communist guerrillas at Dalizi in January 1946 and held at a police station in Changchun in April, they later released only to be rounded up again and locked up at a police station in Jilin. When the Kuomintang forces bombed Jilin, they and prisoners were moved to a prison in Yanji, where her aunt died of malnutrition and opium withdrawal on 20 June 1946. Saga and Husheng were later moved and imprisoned in Shanghai, before they were repatriated to Japan in 1947.\nBack in Japan, they were reunited with Huisheng and stayed at their maternal grandfather Marquis Saneto Saga's house. Husheng and her elder sister Huisheng were educated at various prestigious private schools, including the Gakush\u016bin in Tokyo. During that period, Huisheng and her lover died at Mount Amagi on 10 December 1957 in what appeared to be a murder-suicide case.\nIn November 1960, her father Pujie was released from Fushun War Criminals Management Centre at Fushun, Liaoning following the pardon by the Chinese government and joined the Communist Party. Husheng, who had not seen her father for 16 years, traveled to China with her mother the following year to visit him. Her parents were then reunited and settled in Beijing, while Husheng returned to Japan and became a Japanese citizen though naturalization. Later in 1963, Husheng traveled to China again and stayed with her parents for one year before returning to Japan.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1968, Husheng married Kenji Fukunaga (\u798f\u6c38 \u5065\u6cbb, Fukunaga Kenji) in Kobe, Hy\u014dgo Prefecture and she was renamed to Kosei Fukunaga.
