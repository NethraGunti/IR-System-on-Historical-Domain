One of the bunkers was successfully evacuated by the Polish 1st Mountain Brigade, but the others lacked radio receivers and did not receive the order to retreat. Eventually, the Germans managed to break through the Polish positions, but with heavy casualties on their side and with a significant delay.\n\nHistory\nBefore the battle\nFollowing the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, Poland's southern border became vulnerable to a possible German invasion. Because of that, in April 1939 the General Inspectorate of the Armed Forces dispatched Col. Tadeusz Zieleniewski to prepare plans of fortifications along the border to cover the southern flank of the Krak\u00f3w Army in case of an armed conflict with Nazi Germany. The plan assumed creation of four major fortified areas sealing all four river valleys in the area. The So\u0142a valley was to be blocked by 20 large bunkers located around the village of W\u0119gierska G\u00f3rka, the Koszarawa was to be sealed in Korbiel\u00f3w, Krzy\u017cowa and Przybor\u00f3w, the Skawa shielded in Bystra and Jordan\u00f3w, while the Raba River valley was to be defended by bunkers built in Raba Ni\u017cna. The plan was accepted on 24 June and the construction at W\u0119gierska G\u00f3rka and Korbiel\u00f3w started almost immediately, in early July.\nThe bunkers around W\u0119gierska G\u00f3rka were to form a crescent-shaped defensive position guarding the village and the town in the valley between the hills of over 1000 metres of altitude. All works were carried out by a mobilized unit of Work Battalions led by Major \u015aliwi\u0144ski, with civilians forbidden to enter the construction area. The bunkers were of different types, but all of them were large, able to house at least one anti-tank gun, several heavy machine guns and a crew of up to 20 soldiers. The walls and ceilings were made of reinforced concrete mixed with dense porphyry rocks, which added to their impregnability. All bunkers in the area had code-names starting with the letter W. Despite the plans, in less than two months only five bunkers were more or less ready. On 1 September 1939, at the moment of the German invasion, only four were manned: W\u0119drowiec (Traveller), W\u0105w\u00f3z (Gorge), Walig\u00f3ra (Mountaincracker - name of a folk tale hero) and W\u0142\u00f3cz\u0119ga (Hobo). The fifth one, Wyrwid\u0105b (also named after a folk tale hero) had to be abandoned due to lack of crews. The remaining 15 bunkers were at different stages of construction and most of them were little more than concrete foundations.\nThe four bunkers were also only provisionally prepared. All of them lacked heavy machine gun (HMG) cupolas that were to be mounted on top of the ceilings to cover the battlefield with machine gun fire. There was neither electricity nor telephone network and the only means of communication were signal pipes, steel tubes with reflectors for Morse code communication, completely unusable in the dense smoke of the battle. The lack of electricity also resulted in the crew resorting to usage of kerosene lamps and candles, while the electric water pumps were not operational at all. Finally, the bunkers were insufficiently supplied with ammunition, which was to be delivered on 1 September but in reality never reached the troops.\n\nOpposing forces\nThe four bunkers were manned with the 70 men strong 151st fortress company \"W\u0119gierska G\u00f3rka\" under the command of Captain Tadeusz Semik. The trenches around the bunkers were manned by the Border Defence Corps battalion \"Berezwecz\" under Major Kazimierz Czarkowski and the position was reinforced with two batteries of light artillery and one battery of mountain artillery from the 55th Light Artillery Regiment of the Polish 1st Mountain Brigade. In addition, the Polish forces were reinforced with small detachments of other units, among them two platoons of reserve forces of the \"\u017bywiec\" National Defence battalion and a small detachment of the mobilized Border Guard. Altogether, Captain Semik had roughly 1,200 men at his command.\nAgainst the Polish forces stood the entire German 7th Infantry Division, a part of the XVII Corps of the German 14th Army under Wilhelm List. The division, commanded by Major General Eugen Ott, was composed of three infantry regiments, reinforced with heavy artillery (150 mm). Altogether, the German commander had roughly 17,000 men at his disposal, more than ten times the number available to his opponent.\n\nBattle\nAt half past 4 in the morning, on 1 September, the German 7th Infantry Division crossed the Polish border in the area of Mil\u00f3wka and started their assault towards the Polish positions. Their orders were to break through the weak Polish defences and outflank the Krak\u00f3w Army, thus preventing it from withdrawing eastwards. However, the division was stopped by a delaying action of two Polish infantry companies of the reserve National Defence and Border Defence Corps. Although the Germans outnumbered the Polish forces stationed along the border at least 100 to 1, it was not until the late evening that they finally arrived at the area of Mil\u00f3wka, located only 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the border. Under such circumstance the weak Polish units withdrew to the main lines of the defence in front of W\u0119gierska G\u00f3rka. The Germans arrived there early in the morning of the following day.\nThe German infantry tried to storm the Polish positions on the run, but were bloodily repelled. The German commander then called for artillery and aerial bombardment of the Polish lines and repeated the assaults, which however were all repelled by the infantry battalion manning the field fortifications around the bunkers. By the end of the day the Poles claimed eight enemy armoured vehicles and tanks, while the Germans were forced back to their initial positions between Mil\u00f3wka and W\u0119gierska G\u00f3rka. However, other German units in the area were more successful and Janusz Ga\u0142adyk, the commander of the Polish 1st Mountain Brigade, ordered all Polish units in the area to withdraw overnight to the area of Oczk\u00f3w, where they were to shield the flank of the Polish 21st Infantry Division. However, as the battle continued throughout the night, the orders reached only the \"Walig\u00f3ra\" bunker, artillery units and parts of the \"Berezwecz\" battalion, while the crews of the remaining three bunkers and the infantry units shielding them remained on their positions.\nThe heavy fighting for the area continued until the early morning. \"Walig\u00f3ra\" was manned by seven soldiers from a routed unit and continued to fire at the Germans after the original crew withdrew. However, they were armed with their personal rifles only and had no ammunition left, which forced them to capitulate soon afterwards. All of them were subsequently executed by the Germans. With the Polish infantry and artillery units withdrawn, by dawn the Germans finally managed to outflank the Polish positions and partially encircle them. The crews however decided to continue the struggle until their ammunitions ran out. After a night-long heavy fight, the crew of the \"W\u0142\u00f3cz\u0119ga\" fired their last ammunition at half past 8 o'clock in the morning and capitulated. This sealed the fate of the nearby \"W\u0119drowiec\", as its sides were now open to enemy fire. The German infantry were now able to approach it and throw grenades through the unsealed MG turret shaft. Although no Polish soldiers were wounded, this allowed the Germans to tow anti-tank guns right outside the sealed bunker and fire directly into the MG and artillery nests. The crew withdrew to the safe part of the bunker and continued the fight with rifles, but the bunker's HMG and the 37 mm anti-tank gun were destroyed. Finally, at 5 o'clock in the evening \"W\u0119drowiec\" also capitulated. This allowed the Germans to gain free passage towards Krak\u00f3w and the rear of the withdrawing Krak\u00f3w Army. The crew of the \"W\u0105w\u00f3z\" continued the fight, but the German commander decided to avoid further losses and bypassed it. Realizing this, the crew withdrew overnight and joined other Polish units still in the area.\n\nEyewitness account\nFrom Lemberg to Bordeaux ('Von Lemberg bis Bordeaux'), written by Leo Leixner, a journalist and war correspondent, is a first-hand account of the battles that led to the fall of Poland, the low countries, and France. It includes a rare eye-witness description of the Battle of W\u0119gierska G\u00f3rka. In August 1939, Leixner joined the Wehrmacht as a war reporter, was promoted to sergeant, and in 1941 published his recollections. The book was originally issued by Franz Eher Nachfolger, the central publishing house of the Nazi Party.\n\nNotes and references\nIn-line:\nGeneral:\n\nExternal links\nSimplified map of the battlefield\nBlueprints of the bunkers\nInteractive map and gallery"}
