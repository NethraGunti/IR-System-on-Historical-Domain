Between 1895 and 1900, 235 were built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works of the United States. Some locomotives were modernized in the early 1900s, fitted with superheaters and compound cylinders. Russian Railways designated them \u0425\u043f class. (ru)\nEngines of the \u0425\u043c (Murmansk) sub-class were built and sent to Russia during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War between 1915 and 1916, and transferred to the Murmansk Railway after the war.  These engines were of the same wheel arrangement as the class X, and also built in the U.S. However, they were built by H.K. Porter, Inc. rather than Baldwin and were otherwise very different from the X class.\nIn 1923, there were still 127 steam locomotives of the \u0425 series (including the \u0425\u043c) still in service. By 1940, the number was reduced to 26 engines, and the last of the class was retired in 1955.\n\nCER class \u0425 and MNR \u30bd\u30eaA (SoriA) class\n\nThe Chinese Eastern Railway also bought Baldwin-built locomotives identical to those of the Russian Railways' \u0425 class; Baldwin's works designation for these locomotives was 10.22/42E. Originally designated class \u0411 (B) by the CER, Baldwin in Philadelphia built fifty in 1898 (\u0411151-\u0411200), forty in 1899 (\u0411201-\u0411240), and a final batch of 31 in 1900 (\u0411241-\u0411271). They were redesignated class \u0425 (Kh) in 1921 and numbered \u0425151 through \u0425271.\nAfter the Japanese established the puppet state of Manchukuo, the Soviet Union sold its share of the North Manchuria Railway,  as the CER had been renamed in 1932, to the new state's government on 23 March 1935, It was then merged into the state-owned Manchukuo National Railway, which designated these locomotives \u30bd\u30eaA (SoriA) class. Not all of the CER's \u0425-class engines went to the MNR; some ended up in service in the USSR around Vladivostok.\nIn 2005, an X Locomotive was found buried in Lalin River, Jilin Province, China. This engine, no. 180, was excavated, restored, and is on display outside the Museum of the Imperial Palace of the Manchu State, Changchun.\n\n\n== References =="}
