The 16th, 79th, 10th Reserve, and 5th Reserve Divisions are mentioned as being with that Army Group.  Also, a 102nd Division came from the 3rd War Area early in the campaign but may or may not have been from 32nd Army Group, the text does not make this clear. The 29th Corps is mentioned in the text, along with the 26th Division, in the final attack on Nanchang.  Additionally, a 25th Corps (commander Wang Ching-chiu) and a separate 67th Division are listed as being under the 32nd Army Group in another OOB for the Chinese, from after the Battle of Wuhan to March 1940.[1]\n\nReferences\n[1] Hsu Long-hsuen and Chang Ming-kai, History of The Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) 2nd Ed., 1971.
