General Ting Chao, Li Du, Feng Zhanhai, Xing Zhanqing, and Zhao Yi organised the Jilin Self-Defence Army in order to prevent the fall and occupation of Harbin city, Jilin province. This brought all their forces under a unified command. Calling for civilians to form volunteer units and join in the defense of the city, the army reached a strength of 30,000 men in six brigades of Zhang Xueliangs Northeastern army. \nJilin Self-Defense Corps \u2013 Commander-in-Chief Li Du\n\nFrontline commander-in-chief \u2013 Wang Yu\nChief of the general staff \u2013 Yang Yaojun\nChinese Eastern Railroad Defense Army \u2013 Commander-in-Chief \u2013 Ding Chao\n28th Brigade \u2013 Ding Chao\n22nd Brigade \u2013 Zhao Yi\n25th Brigade \u2013 Ma Xianzhang\n26th Brigade \u2013 Song Wenjun\n29th Brigade \u2013 Wang Ruihua\nTemporary 1st Brigade \u2013 Feng Zhanhai\n1st Cavalry Brigade \u2013 Gong Changhai\n2nd Cavalry Brigade \u2013 Yao Dianchen\nWooded Mountain Guerrilla Force \u2013 Song XizengThe defense of Harbin was at first successful and succeeded in repulsing the Manchukuo forces sent against them for a time. After its initial success, the army was forced out of Harbin when the Japanese sent their own troops under Jiro Tamon.\nTing Chao's beaten Jilin Self-Defence Army retired from Harbin and marched to the northeast down the Songhua River, to join the Lower Songhua garrison of General Li Du and together reorganized, swelling its ranks with volunteers to 30,000 men in nine brigades by April 1932. It continued to resist, occupying the towns along the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, between Harbin and the Soviet border. \nFeng Zhanhai, former regimental commander of the Jilin Guards Division, retreating from Harbin into the west of Jilin province raised a sizeable independent volunteer force, the Northeastern Loyal and Brave Army estimated by the Japanese as 15,000 men in June 1932.\n\nSee also\nPacification of Manchukuo\nSecond Sino-Japanese War\n\nReferences\nCoogan, Anthony, The volunteer armies of Northeast China, History Today; July 1993, Vol. 43 Issue 7, pp.36-41\nNotes On A Guerrilla Campaign, from http://www.democraticunderground.com accessed November 4, 2006\na more readable version here and some photos, from http://forum.axishistory.com, accessed November 4, 2006\nChina's Anti-Japanese War combat operations\nAuthor : Guo Rugui, editor-in-chief Huang Yuzhang\nPress : Jiangsu People's Publishing House\nDate published : 2005-7-1\nISBN 7-214-03034-9\n\u7b2c\u4e8c\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\u4ece\u201c\u4e5d\u4e00\u516b\u201d\u4e8b\u53d8\u5230\u897f\u5b89\u4e8b\u53d8\u54c8\u5c14\u6ee8\u4fdd\u536b\u6218"}
