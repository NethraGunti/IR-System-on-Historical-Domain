Formerly Kamoi had an escort of 28th Tai of 4 destroyers also. It is likely they had similar if not the same escorts here.\nFrom: History of The Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945)\n5/10 11 Ships and 18 planes bombarded Ho-to and Ao-tou. 20 motor boats landed infantry at Wu-tung.\n5/11 More landings at Huang-tso and Ta-tao. 3 destroyers and 2 Gunboats attacked the fortress there to cover the landings. This indicates there was at least one Tai of destroyers with this operation.\n\nChina\nAmoy Defense Operation May 10\u201312, 1938\nAmoy Area - Director, Fukien Pacification HQ. - Chen Yi\n75th Division - Han Wen-ying\nAmoy fortress Command - Kao Hsien-shen\nPai-shih Fortress\nYu-tse-wei Fortress (naval garrison)\n2 Batteries of Fortress Garrison Forces\nHui-li-shan battery\nPan-shih battery\n\nSources\n\nMadej, W.
