Born in Upper Silesia (a border region spanning present day Poland, Germany and the Czech Republic) in 1896, he had fought on the Polish side during the 1921 Silesian Uprisings that followed World War I. After a brief spell living in Poland, he returned to Germany in 1925, where he was forced to fight deportation back to Poland\u2014a case he successfully pursued all the way to the League of Nations in Geneva. Though his firebrand days may have been over by 1939, Honiok was still well known in his German home village of Hohenlieben (modern day, Lubie) \u2014 about 10 miles north of Gleiwitz (modern day, Gliwice) \u2014as a staunch advocate of the Polish cause.\n\nArrest\nFranciszek had been arrested by the SS in the village of Pohlom on August 30, and was ruthlessly selected as the person who would provide the proof of Polish aggression against Germany.  He appears to have been selected because of his involvement in a number of local revolts against German rule in Silesia. According to his surviving family in Poland, Honiok identified strongly with Silesia and Poland.  He underwent a brief incarceration at the police barracks in Beuthen.\n\nHeydrich connection\nAccording to the 1945 Nuremberg trials declaration by Alfred Naujocks, the SS-Sturmbannfuhrer (Major) who was in charge of the operation for Heydrich, at a meeting in Berlin, Heydrich told him how a body, dressed in Polish uniform, was to be left on the Gleiwitz radio station steps to prove the Polish connection. The top secret operation was given a codeword: Gro\u00dfmutter gestorben, (\"Grandmother died\"), to be used by Heydrich to indicate to Naujocks via telephone that the operation was to commence.\n\nDeath\nFranciszek was knocked out with drugs before the raid. He was dragged semi-unconscious into the radio station, where he was shot in the head during the evening of 31 August. Naujocks added that Honiok had been referred to as a piece of Konserve, or \"canned meat\", which could be prepared in advance and used to suggest Polish involvement in the attack.\nThe location of Franciszek's body is unknown, and no memorial exists in his memory.\n\n\n== References =="}
