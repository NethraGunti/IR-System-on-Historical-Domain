The battle, fought between the Wehrmacht and the Polish Army in the vicinity of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, was a direct consequence of the Battle of the Border, an early part of the German Invasion of PolandThe three hills (278 meters above sea level) formed an important strategic point that the German XVI Army Corps needed to break through in order to advance toward Radomsko, Piotrk\u00f3w Trybunalski and Be\u0142chat\u00f3w, and further into central Poland. The area was defended by the Polish 2nd Legions' Infantry Regiment (part of the 2nd Legions Infantry Division), under Col. Ludwik Czy\u017cewski, and the 146th Infantry Regiment (part of the 44th Infantry Division), under Col. Artur Pollak. Both Polish units belonged to \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Army. The invading German XVI Army Corps consisted of the 1st Panzer Division, the 4th Panzer Division, the 14th Infantry Division, and the 31st Infantry Division. During the intense fighting, Polish casualties from the 2nd Legions' Regiment were 663 (including 16 officers and 67 NCOs).\n\nBackground\nGeneral Wiktor Thomm\u00e9e, who commanded Piotrk\u00f3w Operational Group of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Army, ordered Colonel Czy\u017cewski to defend a 25-kilometer line in the area of Rozprza. Polish units were supposed to hold their positions until September 4, when a Polish counterattack was planned from the Sulej\u00f3w forests. Since Czy\u017cewski did not have enough soldiers, he decided to man three main defensive positions, and to patrol the space between them. Center of Polish defence was established in the G\u00f3ry Borowskie hills. Polish units began to man their positions in the night of September 2/3. Janowski's headquarters were at a public school in the village of Jan\u00f3w. General Juliusz R\u00f3mmel, aware of German superiority, decided to reinforce Czy\u017cewski, by sending the 301st Battalion of Light Tanks under Major Edmund Karpow, which consisted of 49 Vickers tanks.\n\nThe battle\nFirst German units approached Polish positions near Rozprza on September 3, at 13:00. Two hours later the Panzers attacked the G\u00f3ry Borowskie hills, and the fighting lasted for several hours, until the night. The Wehrmacht was supported by the Luftwaffe, which bombed Polish positions, and as a result, some soldiers of the Polish Army abandoned their posts. In the evening of September 3, leading units of the German 1st Panzer Division captured Rozprza, to be pushed back after some time. At app. 15:00 tanks of the 4th Panzer Division attacked G\u00f3ry Borowskie, but after a fierce battle with Polish 3rd Battalion of Major \u017belazowski, they retreated and regrouped at night, to attack the hills from the east in the morning of September 4.\nOn September 4 in the morning, German infantry of the 31st I.D. attacked along the road to Be\u0142chat\u00f3w. They were pushed back, but near Rozprza, where Panzer divisions were present, Polish defenders faced more danger. The 1st Panzer attacked Rozprza, and the 4th Panzer concentrated its efforts on capturing Je\u017c\u00f3w. In the afternoon of September 4, whole Polish frontline was attacked between G\u00f3ry Borowskie and Rozprza. Fighting lasted into the night, and in the morning of September 5, the Germans attacked again, with the support of the Luftwaffe. Under the circumstances Colonel Czy\u017cewski ordered retreat towards D\u0142ut\u00f3w, opening for the Wehrmacht the road to Piotrk\u00f3w. Since some Polish units were not aware of Czy\u017cewski's order, in some spots fighting continued until morning of September 6.\n\nSee also\nBattle of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a\n\n\n== Notes and references =="}
