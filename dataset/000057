He was assassinated by Arab gunmen on his way to prayer services at Anglican Christ Church in Nazareth on 26 September 1937.\n\nBiography\nLewis Yelland Andrews was a son of A.E. Andrews from Sydney, Australia. Andrews had fought in World War I for the Australian Imperial Forces. He later served as British district commissioner for Galilee. His assassination on 26 September 1937, caused Britain to respond by outlawing the Arab Higher Committee and the arresting of its members. His assassination was considered to represent the apex of the great Arab revolt in Palestine.\nBefore his murder, one of Andrews' last tasks was to organise a program for the Royal Commission. He allegedly used his influence in favour of partition of the British Mandate. He was the object of particular hatred among Palestinians in the Galilee area for the manner in which he carried out repressive measures after the outbreak of the general strike of 1936.On 26 September 1937, Andrews, Pirie-Gordon (the assistant district commissioner) and Andrews' bodyguard (a British police constable) were on their way from attending service at the Anglican Christ Church, Nazareth when they were gunned down by 4 masked militant followers of Izz ad-Din al-Qassam. Andrews died on the spot and the bodyguard later died at the hospital.\nBritain immediately issued a warrant for the  arrest of Hajj Amin al-Husayni. Shortly afterwards the Arab Higher Committee, of which al-Husayni was chairman, was declared illegal, and a warrant was made out for Husayni's arrest. Al-Husayni holed up in the Haram al-Sharif for some time and eventually slipped out under cover of dark and eventually made his way to Syria which became the committee's new base of operations. In the absence of the established leadership, more radical politicians assumed control of the resistance movement within Palestine itself. Anti-Zionist and anti-British attacks rapidly increased, as did British repression.\nAndrews was buried in Jerusalem and his grave is preserved in the Protestant Mount Zion Cemetery there. He left a widow and three children.\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nSylva M.
