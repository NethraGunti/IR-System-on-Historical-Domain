At Taolaizhao it connects to the Jingha Railway, and at Shulan it connects to the Labin Railway and the Jishu Railway.\n\nHistory\nThe Taolaizhao\u2013Yushu section of the line was originally built in 1943 by the Manchukuo National Railway as the Taoyu Line (T\u014dyu Line in Japanese). It was renamed Taoyu Railway by China Railway, and in 2009 it was extended from Yushu to Shulan to connect with the Labin Railway and the Jishu Railway. It received its current name at that time.\n\nRoute\n\n\n== References =="}
