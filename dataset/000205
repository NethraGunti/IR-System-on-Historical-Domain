Wajda was the son of a Polish Cavalry officer who was murdered in the Katyn massacre.\nThe horse Lotna represents the entire Romantic tradition in culture, a tradition that had a huge influence in the course of Polish history and the formation of Polish literature. Lotna is Wajda's meditation on the historical breaking point that was 1939, as well as a reflection on the ending of an entire era for literature and culture in Poland and in Europe as a whole. Writing of the film, Wajda states that it \"held great hopes for him, perhaps more than any other.\" Sadly, Wajda came to think of Lotna \"a failure as a film.\"\nThe film remains highly controversial, as Wajda includes a mythical scene in which Polish horsemen suicidally charge a unit of German tanks, an event that never actually happened.\n\nSynopsis\nPoland has been invaded by Nazi Germany. Lotna, a beautiful mare that belonged to a wealthy nobleman (Henryk Cudnowski) is given to Captain Chodakiewicz (Jerzy Pichelski), the commander of a Polish Cavalry squadron, and immediately becomes a bone of contention for everyone in the unit.\nLieutenant Wodnicki (Adam Pawlikowski), Cadet Grabowski (Jerzy Moes) and Sergeant Major Laton (Mieczys\u0142aw \u0141oza) jealously scheme among themselves to get their hands on the horse. However, the war takes the lives of Captain Chodakiewicz and Cadet Grabowski, and Lotna falls is passed to Wodnicki. Laton feels he should get the animal and so he steals Lotna and flees amidst the abandoned supply wagons and equipment of the retreating Polish Army.\n\nCast\nJerzy Pichelski as Captain Chodakiewicz\nAdam Pawlikowski as Lieutenant Wodnicki\nJerzy Moes as Cadet Grabowski\nMieczys\u0142aw \u0141oza as Sergeant Major Lato\u015b\nBo\u017cena Kurowska as Ewa\nHenryk Cudnowski as nobleman\nIrena Malkiewicz\nBronis\u0142aw Dardzi\u0144ski\nWies\u0142aw Go\u0142as\n\nLegacy\nDuring an ad limina visit of the Polish bishops to the Vatican, Pope Francis referenced the scene in Lotna depicting an equine competition won by a priest, encouraging the Polish bishops to charge forward like the priest in the film and give witness to their faith in society. When learning that the pope had referenced his film, Andrzej Wajda replied that it was worth living as long as he did.\n\nSee also\nCinema of Poland\nList of Polish language films\nKarol R\u00f3mmel\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nLotna on IMDb\nEssay on Lotna by Peter Gessner"}
