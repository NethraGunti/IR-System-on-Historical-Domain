After the Japanese established the puppet state of Manchukuo, these and other privately owned railways in the territory of Manchukuo were nationalised to create the Manchukuo National Railway, which designated these the Mikani (\u30df\u30ab\u30cb) class. In 1938 they were reclassified Mikasa (\u30df\u30ab\u30b5) class.\nAfter the end of the Pacific War, these locomotives were passed on to the Republic of China Railway. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China, China Railways designated them \u3107\u310e3 (MK3) class in 1951, and subsequently \u89e3\u653e3 (JF3) class in 1959.\n\nPostwar\nThe last of these locomotives were retired in 1990, and one, JF3 2558, is preserved at the Shenyang Steam Locomotive Museum.\n\nSee also\nList of locomotives in China\nChina Railways JF13: in common with JF3 of manufacturer.\n\n\n== References =="}
