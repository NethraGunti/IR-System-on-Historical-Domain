Chen Bijun left Nanjing and took control of the Guangzhou government, which she kept for four months.\n\nPost war\nAfter the surrender of the Japanese in August 1945, she was offered but rejected an evacuation by the Japanese.

On the request of He Xiangning and Song Qingling, Mao and Zhou Enlai offered her a pardon if she would admit guilty on the charge of treason, but as she refused, she remained in prison until her death.\n\n\n== References =="}
