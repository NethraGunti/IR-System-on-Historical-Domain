He was involved in the Chahar People's Anti-Japanese Army in 1933, commanding a formation called the 1st Route.  Following the suppression of the Anti-Japan Allied Army, Wang Ying went over to the Japanese Kwantung Army and persuaded them to let him recruit unemployed Chinese soldiers in Chahar Province. He returned to Japanese-occupied Northern Chahar with enough men to form two Divisions that were trained by Japanese advisors. By 1936 Wang was commander of this Grand Han Righteous Army attached to the Inner Mongolian Army of Teh Wang.\nFollowing the failure of their first Suiyuan campaign, the Japanese used the Grand Han Righteous Army to launch another attempt to take eastern Suiyuan in January 1937. Fu Zuoyi routed Wang\u2019s army, and it suffered heavy losses.After 1937 he was able to establish a small puppet army, independent of Mengjiang, in Western Suiyuan under Japanese protection. His Self Government Army of Western Suiyuan in 1943 consisted of over 2300 men in three divisions, in a March 1943 British intelligence report.After the Surrender of Japan, Wang Ying surrendered to Fu Zuoyi, and was appointed Commander of the 1st Cavalry Group. He was then made Commander of the 14th Cavalry Column, the 12th War Area. In 1946 he was appointed senior staff officer of the Beiping Camp for the Chairperson of the Military Committee (\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u59d4\u54e1\u9577\u5317\u5e73\u884c\u71df\u9ad8\u7d1a\u53c3\u8b00).

He was convicted of treason and anti-revolution and sentenced to death by the Beijing People's Court on May 23, 1950. He appealed to the Supreme People's court, but the court affirmed the original judgement. He was executed by firing squad in Beijing on November 4, 1950.\n\nSee also\nHanjian\nSecond Sino-Japanese War\n\nNotes\nSources\nJowett, Phillip S., Rays of The Rising Sun, Armed Forces of Japan\u2019s Asian Allies 1931-45, Volume I: China & Manchuria, 2004.
