Johnston was also a professor of Chinese at the University of London as well as the British Commissioner of Weihaiwei.\n\nOverview\nTwilight in the Forbidden City was prefaced by Puyi himself in the year 1931.\nJohnston provides a good deal of anecdotal material for the last days of the Qing court before the 1911 Revolution. He knew many of the active players in those events, and his observations on the Qing court's political structure, and in particular the Imperial Household Department, are of historical significance. \nTwilight in the Forbidden City is a history of an entire period and not an exclusive portrait of the last emperor of China. The film The Last Emperor features the book.\nIn the fourth impression, published in December 1934 by Victor Gollancz Ltd., additional information such as the fully spread fan (pp. 448\u20139) was developed and some important parts of the history, such as the confinement of Cao Kun (p. 381) and Kang Youwei's escape from the country (p. 17), were reviewed for modification with \"preface to the fourth impression\" (p. 6) (Japanese translation; ISBN 4-939154-04-1).\n\nPublication history\nReginald F.
