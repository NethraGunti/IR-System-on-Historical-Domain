The rebels, mostly well-disciplined and well-equipped Transjordanian and Syrian volunteers under Fawzi al-Qawuqji, put up a determined fight, killing at least 3 British soldiers and destroying two planes. In the end, the Arab militants retreated after an 8-hour firefight, with the British Army claiming victory.\n\n\n== References =="}
