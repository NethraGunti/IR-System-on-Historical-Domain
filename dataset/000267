It was fought between the forces of the Polish Piotrk\u00f3w Operational Group under Gen. Wiktor Thomm\u00e9e and the German 10th Infantry Division. In the effect of a successive delaying action, the Polish forces managed to regroup and withdraw eastwards while at the same time inflicting heavy losses on the opposing unit. However, their victory was only a temporary setback for the Nazi invasion of Poland.\n\nPrelude\nDue to the strategic errors made by Gen. Juliusz R\u00f3mmel, the commander of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Army, the Polish units that were to form a defensive wedge against the German assault towards Warsaw were dislocated too close to the German border. Because of that, the Piotrk\u00f3w Operational Group, along with the rest of that army's units, entered contact with enemy forces already on September 1 and lost the chance to successfully support the Krak\u00f3w Army and Pozna\u0144 Army, defending the areas on both flanks. Also, the German superiority in mobile units meant that the Polish forces had it difficult to break off the enemy and regain strategic initiative.\nThe chaos in Polish ranks was enlarged by the fast pace of German advance and the fact that general R\u00f3mmel abandoned his army and left for Warsaw. The command was taken over by the commanding officer of the Piotrk\u00f3w Operational Group, general Wiktor Thomm\u00e9e.\n\nOpposing forces\nTo enable regroupment of the dispersed forces of the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Army, Gen. Thomm\u00e9e ordered all the units to move to the forests in the area of the towns of Stryk\u00f3w and G\u0142owno. The Polish forces included Wo\u0142y\u0144ska Cavalry Brigade (along with the remnants of the badly-damaged 21st Vistula Uhlan Regiment), the 2nd Legions Infantry Division, as well as 28th and 30th Infantry Divisions.\nThe opposing force was composed of two infantry divisions of the German 8th Army under Johannes Blaskowitz. These were the 10th Infantry Division under Conrad von Cochenhausen and 24th Infantry Division under Friedrich Olbricht, as well as several smaller detachments of both 10th and 12th Corps.\n\nBattle\nThe first Polish units to reach the area, that is the Wo\u0142y\u0144ska Cavalry Bde and the 30th Infantry Division were ordered to secure the area in order to allow for the remaining units to join up with the core of the army. However, due to chaotic command during the first days of the war, all divisions were dispersed and most regiments acted separately. In the course of the withdrawal it turned out that the 36th Infantry Regiment of the 28th Division was separated from the main forces and had to break through German lines in order to catch up. The same issue applied to the 30th Infantry Regiment of the 10th Infantry Division, which formed a defensive line in the village of Boginia and did not receive the orders for withdrawal."}
