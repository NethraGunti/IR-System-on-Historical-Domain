After Denikin's defeat in the spring of 1920, the division and the 1st Cavalry Army were transferred northwestwards to fight in the Polish\u2013Soviet War, where they recaptured Kiev. During the summer of 1920 the division and the army became bogged down in the Battle of Lw\u00f3w, which resulted in Soviet defeat to the north in the Battle of Warsaw, and the reinforcing 1st Cavalry Army was defeated when it attempted to intervene in the latter. This began a disorganized Soviet retreat, which the army participated in. The division and its army were transferred to Crimea, where Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel led the remnants of the White Army. After the evacuation of remaining White forces from Crimea, the division was moved to Belarus, where it remained for the interwar period. In 1939 and 1940, the 6th Division participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland and the Soviet occupation of Lithuania. After returning to Belarus at the conclusion of the Lithuanian occupation, the division was destroyed in the June 1941 German invasion of the Soviet Union and officially disbanded in September.\n\nHistory\nThe division traced its lineage back to the 1st Stavropol Cavalry Division, formed in October 1918 from the Stavropol Cavalry Brigade, composed of Stavropol partisan cavalry. On 20 January 1919, the division was renamed the 1st Soviet Cavalry Division. After the disbandment of the Caspian-Caucasian Front, all of its cavalry units, including the division, were consolidated into a single cavalry division by an order dated 18 March 1919. On 26 March, the division was redesignated the 6th Cavalry Division. The division became part of the 10th Army and was commanded by Iosif Apanasenko. In June it became part of Semyon Budyonny's Cavalry Corps of the 10th Army.\n\nCommanders\nThe following officers commanded the division.\nSavely Negovora (9 January\u201326 March 1919)\nIosif Apanasenko (26 March\u201324 June 1919)\nSemyonov (24 June\u201314 July 1919)\nBoris Solovyov (acting; 14\u201315 July 1919)\nIosif Apanasenko (15\u201317 July 1919)\nAlexey Polyakov (acting; 17 July\u201324 August 1919)\nGrigory Baturin (24 August\u20133 October 1919)\nIosif Apanasenko (3 October\u20133 November 1919)\nSemyon Timoshenko (3 November 1919 \u2013 5 August 1920)\nIosif Apanasenko (5 August\u201312 October 1920)\nYakov Sheko (acting; 12\u201327 October 1920)\nOka Gorodovikov (27 October 1920 \u2013 May 1924)\nAlexander Tarnovsky-Terletsky (1926)\nLeonid Veyner (October 1929 \u2013 17 August 1933)\nIvan Selivanov (1933)\nKombrig Dmitry Veynerkh (22 January or 22 April 1934 \u2013 Unknown)\nColonel (promoted to Kombrig 17 February 1938) Anton Lopatin (July 1937 \u2013 September 1938)\nKombrig (converted to Major general 4 June 1940) Pyotr Makarov (14 August 1939 \u2013 March 1941)\nMajor General Mikhail Konstantinov (14 March \u2013 19 September 1941)\n\nReferences\nCitations\nBibliography\nDvoinykh, L.V.; Kariaeva, T.F.; Stegantsev, M.V., eds.
