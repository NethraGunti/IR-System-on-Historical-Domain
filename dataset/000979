In 2013, he continues to deny that women were forced to work in brothels during wartime. He claims that the Nanjing Massacre was a complete fabrication, was a supporter of right-wing filmmaker Satoru Mizushima's 2007 film The Truth about Nanjing, which denied that the massacre ever occurred.

He made several controversial statements since his appointment, such as saying: \"I will stand at the forefront to destroy the Japan Teachers' Union, which is a cancer for Japanese education\". In a press conference related to his Minister of Tourism portfolio, he declared that Japan is basically \"ethnically homogeneous,\" which greatly angered the Ainu, an indigenous ethnic minority living mostly in Northern Japan.
