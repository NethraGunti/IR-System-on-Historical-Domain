One of its chief supporters was Zhang Xueliang who  privately supported this resistance, despite his public obedience to the government policy of non resistance.  Zhang was not publicly associated with the Society and never held office in it, but provided funds and allowed it to use his name when communicating with volunteer armies.The society was dissolved in 1933, under pressure from Chinese government in Nanjing.\n\nReferences\n\nRana, Mitter (2000).
