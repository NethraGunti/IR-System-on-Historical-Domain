When the Communists took over the family fled back to Japan. After her father died in 1953, she went to work as a singer and then as a burlesque dancer. At the time of filming for The Barbarian and the Geisha she was 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m) and weighed 115 pounds (52 kg). When director John Huston was looking for an actress for the part of Okichi, a friend of Ando's who worked in the Tokyo office of 20th Century-Fox recommended Ando to Huston. Once Huston saw her, after auditioning 33 other actresses, he and producer Eugene Frenke were done looking, mainly because of her height over the other women.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nEiko Ando on IMDb\nEiko Ando at AllMovie"}
