This happened in reaction to the Chinese 1939-40 Winter Offensive in Suiyuan during the Second Sino-Japanese War.  The Japanese call it \u7b2c\uff12\u6b21\u5f8c\u5957\u4f5c\u6226 (\"The Second Battle of Wuyuan\").\nBy the 28th of January 1940 the Japanese had built up forces from the 26th Division at Baotou sufficient to launch the \u7b2c\uff11\u6b21\u5f8c\u5957\u4f5c\u6226 or \"First battle of Wuyuan in Inner Mongolia\" to recover lost territory and move west to take Wuyuan which fell on February 3 and Linhe further west on the 4th of February.\n\nUnits\nJapanese Forces:\nMongolia Garrison Army \u99d0\u8499\u8ecd - Naosaburo Okabe\n\n26th Division - Lt.

On the night of the 20th they entered Wuyuan by surprise and after a seesaw fight over the strongpoint captured the city at 1600 hours on the 21st. The Japanese garrison retreated northward. Chinese forces then moved on to capture a strongpoint around Hsin-an-chen on the 22nd. This cut the road along the Yellow River to Wuyuan.\nIn an attempt to recover the situation the Japanese sent 600 troops from Dashetai via Siyitang in 80 trucks to make a forced crossing of the Wu-chia River at Ta-tsai-chu 10 km (6.2 mi) north of Wuyuan.  For three days they fought the 101st Division without success.  By the 25th they had been reinforced to 3,000 men and made the crossing with artillery and air support.  Wuyuan again fell to the Japanese on the 26th and the Chinese fell back to the banks of Fang-chi-chu and continued their attacks at Xin'an, Xishanzui, Xixiaozhao, and Man-ko-su.\nUnable to withstand the pressure of Chinese attacks, the Japanese at Wuyuan retreated on March 30 and 31. On April 1 a guerrilla force and cavalry column recaptured Wuyuan, and the 11th Provisional Division recaptured Wu-pu-lang-kou. On April 3, cavalry recovered Xishanzui as the Japanese retreated to the east.\nJapan used poison gas against the Chinese armies at the Battle of Wuyuan and Battle of West Suiyuan.\n\nSources\nHsu Long-hsuen and Chang Ming-kai, History of The Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945) 2nd ed., 1971.
