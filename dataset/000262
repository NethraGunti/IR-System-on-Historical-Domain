It was the second largest battle of the Invasion of Poland (Battle of Bzura was the largest) and also the largest tank battle of the campaign. It resulted in the surrender of Army Krakow  on 20 Sept. 1939.The battle can be divided into two phases - from 19 to 20 September and from 21 to 26 September. They are often referred to in French sources as the First and Second battle of Tomasz\u00f3w, respectively.\n\nFirst phase\nIn the first phase (also known as the First Battle of Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski), Polish forces, composed of Army Lublin and Army Krakow under general Piskor attempted to break through the German positions around Tomasz\u00f3w towards the Romanian Bridgehead area. Both armies forces on September 15, in the area southwest of Frampol. Their road towards south was blocked, however, by two German corps - VIII Army Corps (around Bi\u0142goraj), and by XXII Panzer Corps, consisting of 2nd Panzer Division and 4th Light Division (around Hrubiesz\u00f3w, Zamo\u015b\u0107 and Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski). Polish forces, concentrated around Frampol, were surrounded by six to seven German divisions. Since neither Army Krak\u00f3w, nor Army Lublin had any aircraft, general Antoni Szylling, commander of Army Krak\u00f3w, decided to risk and attack the Germans, without knowing their real strength. He knew that panzer forces had already approached Rawa Ruska, and hoped that their units would be stretched along the road from Jaros\u0142aw to Rawa. Polish forces included one of the largest Polish armored units of that time, the Warsaw Armoured Motorized Brigade, and Szyling, together with general Piskor, decided that the Warsaw Brigade would make a demonstration attack on Tomasz\u00f3w, drawing the attention of the Germans. Joined Polish forces were made of five infantry divisions - 3rd, 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and 55th. Furthermore, they consisted of 1st Mountain Brigade, Krak\u00f3w Cavalry Brigade, and Warsaw Armoured Motorized Brigade. However, after days of heavy fighting, Polish units were reduced to 30-50% of their original strength (except for the Armoured Brigade), lacking batteries, antitank ammunition and controllers. Furthermore, communication between separate divisions was strong, and they had no lots of support, which was a huge advantage, as they had an idea about movements and location of German forces.\n\nThese plans, however, were quickly changed, after the Germans destroyed key Polish unit, 21st Mountain Division near the village of Dzikowiec, on September 15/16, killing general J\u00f3zef Kustro\u0144. General Piskor, realizing that German forces were stronger than he had thought, decided to act quickly, without waiting for all his divisions to concentrate. On September 17, he ordered Warsaw Armoured Motorized Brigade to attack Tomasz\u00f3w and keep the town until main forces of Army Krak\u00f3w joined the brigade. Tomasz\u00f3w was attacked on September 18 in the morning, and by 1 p.m. half of the town was in Polish hands. Meanwhile, however, 4th Light Division joined the battle, striking rear Polish units and forcing them to withdraw. Thus, the attempt to capture Tomasz\u00f3w in a surprise attack, failed. In the night of September 18/19, Warsaw Brigade, supported by infantry of 23rd and 55th divisions, attacked Tomasz\u00f3w again, but without success. Third attack took place in the night of September 19/20, but Polish units were disorganized and demoralized. After a series of chaotic skirmishes, with number of killed and wounded growing, and ammunition shrinking, general Piskor decided to surrender. Some 11,000 Polish soldiers were captured, with small groups managing to hide in forests.\nMeanwhile, Operational Group \"Boruta\" (named after General Mieczys\u0142aw Boruta-Spiechowicz), which was part of Army Krak\u00f3w, separated from main Polish forces and marched towards Narol. Surrounded by Germans, Polish units were destroyed one by one. Some managed to reach the area of Rawa Ruska, where 3,000 soldiers surrendered on September 20, ending this phase of the battle.\n\nSecond phase\nThe second phase (also known as the Second Battle of Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski) involved Polish units from the so-called Northern Front - remaining elements of Army Lublin, Army Modlin and Operational Groups Wyszk\u00f3w, Narew and Nowogr\u00f3dzka Cavalry Brigade under generals Emil Krukowicz-Przedrzymirski and Stefan D\u0105b-Biernacki. On September 20, these forces were some 40 kilometers north of Tomasz\u00f3w, in the area of Sitaniec. General D\u0105b-Biernacki, who commanded them, until the final hours had no idea about the ongoing battle and did not help fighting troops. At the same time, general Piskor did not know about D\u0105b-Biernacki's units operating northeast of Tomasz\u00f3w. Altogether, forces of Northern Front had 39,000 soldiers and 225 cannons. They were divided into three groups - Cavalry of general W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders, Operational Group of general Jan Kruszewski, and Operational Group of general Emil Krukowicz-Przedrzymirski. Polish forces were no match to German 10th Army and 14th Army, guarding the roads to the south, but general D\u0105b-Biernacki, at a meeting of his officers on September 18 in the village of Wereszcze Du\u017ce near Che\u0142m, decided to go along with an attempt to break to Hungary or Romania. D\u0105b-Biernacki already knew that Red Army had invaded Poland the day before, so time was of crucial importance.\nNorthern Front forces marched southwards from the area of Che\u0142m in two columns, towards Zamo\u015b\u0107, which D\u0105b-Biernacki decided to attack. On September 18, Poles attacked Krasnystaw, but failed to capture it. On next day, D\u0105b-Biernacki ordered the attack on Zamo\u015b\u0107 to be carried out on Sept. 20, but in the night of Sept 19/20, he found out about the ongoing battle of Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski and decided to help. Northern Front units headed towards Tomasz\u00f3w, but on September 20 in the evening, they were attacked by 4th Light Division and 27th Infantry Division near Cze\u015bniki. Meanwhile, units of Operational Group of general Emil Krukowicz-Przedrzymirski reached the area of Tomasz\u00f3w, and on September 21, a few hours the first phase of the battle had ended, attacked troops under command of general Ernst Busch (28th J\u00e4ger Division and 8th J\u00e4ger Division). Since Polish forces proved to be stronger than expected, field marshal Wilhelm List decided to send reinforcements to general Busch - 68th Infantry Division, 27th I.D., and 2nd Panzer Division, which had just mopped Polish forces in the first phase of the battle of Tomasz\u00f3w Lubelski.\nIn the evening of September 22, cavalry of general W\u0142adys\u0142aw Anders attacked, capturing Krasnystaw, and then reaching Sambor. Other Polish units were not successful, and in several skirmishes were surrounded on September 23. General D\u0105b-Biernacki ordered his officers to capitulate, escaped the encirclement, and left Poland, ending up in France. General Przedrzymirski refused to obey the order, and on September 24 attacked Krasnobr\u00f3d, but then was stopped by 8th Jager Division. Most of the remaining Polish forces capitulated around 26 September.\n\nOrder of Battle\nReferences\n\n\n== External links =="}
